# Soundpath
Soundpath is a web application that provides road trip directions and creates a playlist of public media stories about the people and places along the route.    

The idea was first presented as part of a ["Hack the Future of Journalism"](http://www.rjionline.org/hackathon2014/soundpath-final-presentation) hackathon at KQED in San Francisco.


## This is a work in progress

**Here's a basic overview of what we're working on:**

1. Getting the route information. (DONE) 
2. Identifying places and points of interest along the path. (IN PROCESS)

* Currently, we're using city halls near the route to identify towns of interest. 

3. Searching the Public Media Platform for related stories. (TBD)
4. Building a playlist from PMP content. (TBD)

**In the future we'd like to:**

1. Allow users to save and edit playlists
2. Improve matching between place and audio piece.

* Better geographic information about stories in the PMP would let us expand use from road tripâ€“scale distances to daily commuters and urban tourists. 
* Better identify stories about a specific place, rather than stories simply created by a local public radio station.
