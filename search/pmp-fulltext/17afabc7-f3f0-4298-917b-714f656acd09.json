The success is largely due to a series of deals between the city and major creditors, especially general retirees who agreed to accept smaller pension checks.</p><p>Judge Steven Rhodes found the overall plan is fair and feasible, a key threshold in bankruptcy law. He announced his decision Friday.</p><p>No significant critics were left at the end of trial last week. Bond insurers with more than $1 billion at stake settled for much less.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.law.umich.edu/FacultyBio/Pages/FacultyBio.aspx?FacID=pottow\" target=\"_blank\">John Pottow</a></strong>, law professor at the University of Michigan Law School and an expert in the field of bankruptcy.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
