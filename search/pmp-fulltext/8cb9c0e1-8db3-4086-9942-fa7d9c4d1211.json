Mendelssohn wrote it in 1842 at age 33, five years before his death.</p><p>Mendelssohn scholars, however, have already known about the existence of this formerly lost song: It was sold at auction twice, first in 1862 and then again in 1872. The manuscript includes Mendelssohn's signature, proving its authenticity and making it a valuable piece of paper even without this little <em>lied</em>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-27253932\" target=\"_blank\">BBC 4's <em>Today</em> program</a> asked two performers from London's Royal College of Music, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2011/11/16/142376606/talk-like-an-opera-geek-managing-mezzos-altos-and-contraltos\" target=\"_blank\">alto</a> Amy Williamson and pianist Christopher Glynn, to perform the newly rediscovered piece, whose text is drawn from a poem by Friedrich Rückert called <em>Das Unveränderliche</em> and which is not even a minute and a half long.</p><p>Where has this song been all this time? That remains a bit of a mystery. According to the BBC, the manuscript \"emerged in a private collection in the U.S.\" and will be sold at Christie's auction house later this month, where it is anticipated to sell for roughly $25,000-$42,000.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
