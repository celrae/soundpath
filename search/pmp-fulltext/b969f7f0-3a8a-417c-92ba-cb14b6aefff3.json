In California, come January 1st, those practices will be different.</p><p>Governor Jerry Brown this week signed <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB2127\" target=\"_blank\">a new law</a> that limits full-contact drills for all teams in public and private middle and high schools. The legislation comes amid concerns about concussions and brain injuries in football.</p><p>California Assemblyman <strong>Ken Cooley</strong>, who sponsored the bill, told <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson that California is following a model implemented by the NFL to minimize concussions. Where the NFL has reduced head injuries, high schools still have work to do.</p><p>&#8220;Hundreds of thousands of kids in American high school football programs are getting concussions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And medical folks who&#8217;ve done the surveys say two-thirds to three-quarters of the concussions are coming out of practice when they&#8217;re playing with their buddies.&#8221;</p><p>The new bill will require students who get concussions to be out for one week in order to facilitate healing. It also limits the amount of full-contact practices per week.</p><p>Cooley says he&#8217;s not concerned that the new safety measures could impact California&#8217;s competitive edge against other big high school sports states.</p><p>&#8220;Coaches are not gonna need three hours a week of hard-hitting practice to develop talent,&#8221; Cooley explained. &#8220;The game has evolved.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://asmdc.org/members/a08/\" target=\"_blank\">Ken Cooley</a></strong>, California state assemblyman representing the 8th Assembly District.
