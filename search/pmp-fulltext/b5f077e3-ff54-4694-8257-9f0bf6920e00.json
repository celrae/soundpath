I'm a notebook nut. I own dozens and dozens of them. Everything from cheap reporter's notebooks to hand-crafted Italian leather beauties.</p><p>I wondered: Am I an analog dinosaur, or are there others out there like me?</p><p>The first stop in my investigation was, frankly, discouraging.</p><p>At first glance, a Starbucks on the campus of George Washington University points to the dinosaur conclusion. So plentiful are the laptops and tablets that they outnumber the double-mocha-half-caf-triple-shot-Frappuccinos.</p><p>But when I look more closely, I spot plenty of paper here as well.</p><p>Evan DeFransciso, a 20-year-old student, says he makes a clear demarcation: digital for schoolwork and paper for \"my creative writing ... short stories, poems, personal thoughts.\"</p><p>\"The stuff that really matters goes onto the paper,\"<strong> </strong>he says.</p><p>Not just any paper. He uses a small black notebook with an elastic band and a storied past. Picasso and Hemingway used an early version of the Moleskine, and now you can, too.</p><p>The Italian company that makes Moleskines — all 500 versions — is red hot, consistently recording double-digit sales growth.</p><p>Oddly enough, the analog company's success has grown in tandem with the digital revolution. In fact, when conducting market research, the company detected something even more perplexing: a direct correlation between sales of its little black notebooks and proximity to an Apple store.</p><p>That led Moleskine CEO Arrigo Berni to conclude that his customers are \"not people who are clinging to paper with a nostalgic feeling, but rather people that have both digital and analog as part of their lives.\"</p><p>Yes, he says, we live in an increasingly digital world, but we \"still have a need for physical experience, for emotional experiences that digital devices and technology\" don't always provide.</p><p>Besides, he adds, for so-called digital natives, iPhones and other high-tech gadgets are commonplace. Paper is the curiosity.</p><p>Consider the case of Angelia Trinidad, recent college graduate and self-proclaimed gadget freak.</p><p>Not that long ago, she found herself adrift, professionally and emotionally, so she sought out a planner, a paper planner. None felt quite right so she designed her own.</p><p>Smelling a business opportunity, she turned to Kickstarter to get funding. In <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/angeliatrinidad/passion-planner-the-one-place-for-all-your-thought?ref=users\">one of her campaigns</a>, she was aiming for $10,000; she raised more than half a million.</p><p>\"We went viral for a whole week, and it was insane,\" she says.</p><p>Friends urged her to launch a digital version of her planner, but she resisted.</p><p>\"I put my foot down,\" Trinidad says. \"I said 'no apps.' \"</p><p>She has nothing against apps — her smartphone is chockablock with them — but she finds paper more intimate.</p><p>\"It's this thing that is so intuitive. It's between you and paper and a pen. It's kind of meditative,\" she says. \"When I'm on the phone, it's never meditative. It's always task-y.\"</p><p>Paper, Trinidad says, makes the abstract tangible, in a way that digital devices don't.</p><p>\"I feel there's a huge need for paper in this increasingly digital world,\" she adds. \"I look at my planner and I think of it as my second brain. I look back at something on there and it's like, 'Oh, I wrote that.' \"</p><p>I know what she means. As a writer, no work feels complete until I hit the print button and it's on paper. Maybe, though, Angelia and I are both dinosaurs, albeit from different generations.</p><p>But some recent research suggests otherwise. Pam Mueller was a teaching assistant for an introductory psychology class at UCLA. One day, she forgot to bring her laptop to class.</p><p>\"So I took notes, you know, the old-fashioned way, the way I did in college — pen and paper,\" she explains. \"I thought I got so much more out of the lecture that day.\" <strong></strong></p><p>She mentioned this to her professor, Daniel Oppenheimer. It turns out that he had a<strong> </strong>similar experience in a faculty meeting. He was dutifully taking notes on his laptop but realized he had no idea what people were saying.</p><p>Oppenheimer and Mueller wondered if there was something about paper and the act of writing that explained this phenomenon, so they conducted an experiment.</p><p>They asked about 50 students to attend a lecture. Half took notes on laptops and half with pen and paper. Both groups were then given a comprehension test.</p><p>It wasn't even close. The students who used paper <a href=\"http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/take-notes-by-hand-for-better-long-term-comprehension.html\">scored significantly higher</a> than those who used laptops.</p><p>Mueller attributes this unexpected finding — <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/04/22/0956797614524581.abstract\">published in the journal, Psychological Science</a> — to the fact that the \"analog\" note takers were forced to synthesize rather than merely transcribe. It's a phenomenon known as \"desirable difficulty.\"</p><p>\"Desirable difficulty is some small roadblock that is in your path that actually improves your understanding of a topic,\" she explains.</p><p>This is, admittedly, a hard sell on college campuses, she concedes.</p><p>\"Students find it hard to believe that more content isn't better,\" she adds, \"that they aren't going to just get it all down now and study it later.\"</p><p>Mueller, though, has taken her research findings to heart. Whenever she needs to truly grasp a subject, she ditches the laptop and takes notes with old-fashioned pen and paper.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
