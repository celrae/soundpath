We've also changed the text — which had used the word \"shocks,\" too — because marine biologist Zachary Jud and others had previously done work on the lionfish's ability to survive in estuaries.</p><p>For a timeline on the work that's been done by scientists, <a href=\"http://absci.fiu.edu/2014/07/just-because-people-keep-asking/\" target=\"_blank\">see this blog post</a> written by Professor Craig Layman of North Carolina State University. He concludes that \"Lauren had made a contribution to science. One can argue the magnitude of this finding, but a contribution regardless.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
