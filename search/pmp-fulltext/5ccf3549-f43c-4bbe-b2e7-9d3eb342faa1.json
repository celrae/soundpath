Joseph says that at the same time, there is persistent, institutional inequality, that the young people in Ferguson know from their own life.</p><p>Joseph told <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Meghna Chakrabarti that with those competing realities, it&#8217;s hard to have the kinds of clear goals that united a lot of Americans to action in the civil rights era.
