All New Yorkers age 14 and older may apply, regardless of immigration status.","itags":["npr_api","376788822"],"guid":"4fef4c5f-37c7-4543-9467-6b4213141359","contentencoded":"<p>In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio made a pitch for a piece of plastic on Monday — a <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/site/idnyc/index.page\" target=\"_blank\">new ID card for New York City residents</a>, regardless of immigration status.</p><p>\"One piece of plastic, but it's going to open so many doors for our fellow New Yorkers. It's going to make their lives better,\" de Blasio said.</p><p>New Yorkers 14 and older can now join the largest municipal identification program in the country. De Blasio said renting an apartment, opening a bank account and entering a school building will now be easier for the city's estimated half-million unauthorized immigrants.</p><p>\"We don't want any of our fellow New Yorkers to feel like second-class citizens. We don't want them to feel left out,\" he said.</p><p>And the IDNYC program doesn't leave out New Yorkers who already have ID. Here's how the mayor sweetened the deal: \"A free, one-year membership to 33 cultural institutions! That did get the attention of many New Yorkers,\" he said.</p><p>Johanna Miller of the New York Civil Liberties Union says getting lots of New Yorkers — not just unauthorized immigrants — to sign up will be key.</p><p>\"The success of this program depends almost entirely on having a diverse pool of cardholders. If the card becomes a scarlet letter for undocumented people then it fails,\" Miller says.</p><p>Los Angeles is preparing to roll out an ID similar to New York's. They join cities like San Francisco; Oakland, Calif.; and New Haven, Conn., where only about 10 percent of the city's population has applied since 2007.</p><p>New York officials hope their program will be more widely adopted.</p><p>There were already long lines today at the Queens Library's Flushing branch, where Ni Shaolong, 75, waited to apply.</p><p>The ID is definitely \"a good thing,\" Ni says in Mandarin.</p><p>He says he plans to use it to check out books from the public library and visit some of the city's museums for free.</p><p>For Wa Sutardji, an immigrant from Indonesia who makes sushi at a Manhattan restaurant, the new ID will help answer more practical questions.</p><p>\"Everywhere you go, everybody's asking, 'Can I have your ID? Can I have your ID?' This thing is good for the people who don't have the identity,\" he says.</p><p>What may not be good, Miller says, is that privacy protection for cardholders under New York City law is limited.</p><p>\"Currently, this law, unfortunately, would allow law enforcement to seek your information by only showing that it's relevant to an investigation — and that could be an investigation about somebody else,\" she says.</p><p>Miller says probable cause isn't required for law enforcement or other government agencies to request cardholders' information.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
