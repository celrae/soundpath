He talked about cigars and competitive smoking with <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a slow smoking event, so everyone&#8217;s given the exact same cigar, which is fairly small,&#8221; Cioffi said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the type of cigar you might smoke in 20 or 30 minutes. The main goal is to smoke it for as long as possible without the cigar going out.&#8221;</p><p>While a competitive smoking title has its own brand of prestige in the cigar world, the competition won&#8217;t have spectators on the edge of their seats.</p><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really dancing on the edge of not smoking at all. I always say it&#8217;s simultaneously incredibly exciting and the world&#8217;s most boring activity, because you&#8217;re barely puffing away at the cigar,&#8221; Cioffi said. &#8220;And then they make it even more complicated with a whole bunch of other rules. You can&#8217;t blow on it, you can&#8217;t blow through it, you can&#8217;t set it down. Before I ever competed, when I read the list of rules I was a little bit scared, it sounded kind of daunting, but it&#8217;s actually very fun.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;I always say it&#8217;s simultaneously incredibly exciting and the world&#8217;s most boring activity, because you&#8217;re barely puffing away at the cigar.&#8221;<div class=\"pullquoteauth\">&ndash; Darren Cioffi</div></p><p></div></p><p>So what&#8217;s the strategy? Cioffi says it&#8217;s all about preparation. After that, experience takes over.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really anybody&#8217;s game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean, 50 percent of it is the cigar you select. If you understand how cigars are made, and you know how to select a good cigar; you have half the battle right there. Beyond that, it becomes your skill, knowing how the cigar is burning, knowing what it might do based on what it&#8217;s doing. If you&#8217;re a real cigar smoker, you do have a shot at these things.&#8221;</p><p>The health questions surrounding competitive smoking are obvious. But Cioffi says cigars are meant to be enjoyed, and always in moderation.</p><p>&#8220;If you smoke cigars in the fashion that one smokes cigarettes, I&#8217;d be very worried about your health,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m in the cigar industry and it&#8217;s my life, and I smoke less than a cigar a day. It&#8217;s really something to be enjoyed, and especially when you&#8217;re doing it at the level that I am, you&#8217;re smoking very special stuff that you really look forward to, and that is a premium thing to be enjoyed on special occasions.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.crcnashville.org/portfolio/darren-cioffi/\" target=\"_blank\">Darren Cioffi</a></strong>, owner of <a href=\"http://www.principlecigars.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Principal Cigars</a> and winner of the 2014 Cigar Smoking World Championship.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
