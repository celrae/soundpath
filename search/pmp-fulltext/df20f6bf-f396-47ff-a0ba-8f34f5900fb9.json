But what happens when that different identity doesn't fit anymore?</p><p>Take singer-songwriter Marina Diamandis, for example. For about two years, she took on a different persona â€” the dark brunette donned a platinum-blonde wig and became Electra Heart, which doubles as the title of her second album. For her newest LP, <em>Froot</em>, Diamandis is back to her old stage name: Marina And The Diamonds.</p><p>Diamandis ditched her alter ego for a sound and persona that's all her own. \"In terms of the production and the way that the vocal was produced, I didn't feel that it represented who I truly was,\" she says. At the audio link, hear her discuss <em>Froot</em> and the experiences that led to the change in an interview with NPR's Rachel Martin.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
