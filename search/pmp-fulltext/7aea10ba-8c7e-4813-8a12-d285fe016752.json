Go get a job — babysit!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> But Chris&nbsp;asked if you had&nbsp;any <em>fun</em> ideas.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> I <em>gave</em> you a fun idea! I said look him dead in the eye and say <em>“Stop taking all my fucking money!”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s pretty fun. That’s a roller coaster ride, socially speaking.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> I’ve made a career out of it!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> You know, we have the Posts — Emily Post’s great grand children –&nbsp;come by giving certain etiquette advice… but&nbsp;I like your direct approach to etiquette. I think we’re going to get along.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Yeah; I can almost predict the rest of your answers though.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> Well, let’s see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Let’s see.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> <em>Don’t judge a book by its fucking cover!</em></p>\n<br />\n<p>Sorry, I’ll stop cursing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<br />\n<h2>Unsolicited AV Assistance</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> All right, so this next question comes from Scott in L.A. Scott writes, “I’m a video editor –”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> Oooh, in L.A.?!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Can you believe it?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> What a nice change of pace!&nbsp; Keep going.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong>&nbsp;”Knowing video formats and sizes is what I’m paid to do.&nbsp;Sometimes when I go to my friend’s homes I notice their TVs aren’t set up correctly.&nbsp; The image is scaled oddly, or they’re watching SD channels when I know an HD version is available –”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> What a laid back dude. Scott’s his name?&nbsp;We’re <em>shocked</em> his name is Scott, by the way.&nbsp; Keep going.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong>&nbsp;”What is the proper etiquette for offering to fix their setup, or at least suggest they’re doing it wrong? I don’t want to be obnoxious and over-reach.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> See, he knows on some level that it’s a little obnoxious.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote data-pullquote=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> <q>The proper etiquette is… <em>get a life</em>, is the proper etiquette!</q> I’m so sick of people complaining, “Ohhh, it’s not in HD!” Who <em>are</em> you?! There are homeless people outside! Homeless people who love Glenn Close –&nbsp;and they don’t have HD or SD! They don’t have <em>anything!</em> They barely have a little… in <em>my</em> day I had a portable compact disc player –&nbsp;that was the only form of entertainment I had! So stop being so judgmental about people’s entertainment!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> But wouldn’t Meryl Streep look better on HD, Billy?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> She <em>always</em> looks great, she hasn’t aged a day since “Kramer vs. Kramer!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Just ask the people of New York.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> <em>Scott</em>. If Scott came to <em>my</em> house and said “Oooohh, can we watch a show in HD?” No! No you can’t!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> But isn’t it a simple way to make someone’s life better? “Look: with&nbsp;the touch of a button, I can make this more pleasing to the eye.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Brian Eichner:</strong> Get out of here! Come on!&nbsp; You come over to my house… by the way, you’re going to go to someone’s house and sit there and watch TV? Who are you, my uncle Lester?!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Scott, I just want you to know I would defend you more, but I’m a little afraid to do so right now.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Brian Eichner:</strong> How boring!!! Play a board game! <em>Talk</em> for five minutes — you’re on your damn phone all day long, and then you’re gonna, “Oh yeah, let’s just throw all caution to the wind and watch some <em>television!!</em>“</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> And he’s a video editor! So he’s already doing that at work. Get some exercise.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> I’m sure Scott’s a real looker, by the way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Oh my word.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> So that’s the polite way to deal with things — there you go Scott!</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> You’re actually giving me a good idea. I’ve been getting a lot of interest in people wanting me to write a book.&nbsp; But I don’t know — everyone, every stupid comedian writes a book — but you’re giving me a good idea: I’ll write an etiquette book.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Well, give us a cut, okay?</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Yeah, so we’ll get 15 to 39 percent of that.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> Yeah, I know –&nbsp;you guys always want every cent you can get, here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> We’ve got it on tape.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> Somehow <em>Terry Gross</em> doesn’t need my nickels and dimes. You know what I mean?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/1XP5zczzJwY\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<h2>Don’t Call Me, I Won’t Call You</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> This is something from Trying To Be Gentle.&nbsp; It comes via our website – they don’t even what to tell us where they’re from.</p>\n<br />\n<p>“What do I say,”&nbsp;Trying To Be Gentle&nbsp;asks, “When someone asks me for my phone number… and I’m not interesting in giving it to them?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> I’ll answer that one honestly, since I’ve been giving your viewers a hard time so far.</p>\n<br />\n<p>I think in that case, you know what I say actually? I say, “You know what? Let me just give you my email.&nbsp; Because it’s quicker, I’m on email all day long, and honestly you’ll get a quicker response out of me via email.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> I.e. <em>never</em>.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> So you <em>lie</em> to them, is what you’re saying?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> Yeah!&nbsp; Hello! Welcome to show business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I like how you had a&nbsp;nicer tone of voice, but your core answer was still “lie to them.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner</strong>: Well I’ll be honest, I miss Scott. I do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Billy Eichner, thank you so much for telling our audience how to behave.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Billy Eichner:</strong> Thank you, it was fun. Thanks for having me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br /></div>","audio":[{"meta":{"width":null,"crop":"primary","height":null},"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Fuse_BOTS_HR-KAREEM-BLACK.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"meta":{"height":null,"crop":"primary","width":null},"type":"image/jpeg","href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Fuse_BOTS_interview.jpg"},{"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Fuse_BOTS_HR-KAREEM-BLACK-323x4751.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"height":null,"crop":"primary","width":null}},{"type":"image/jpeg","href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/139470847sq.jpg","meta":{"height":null,"crop":"primary","width":null}},{"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Fuse_BillyOnTheStreet-315x4751.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"width":null,"height":null,"crop":"primary"}},{"meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg","href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/billy_on_the_street.jpg"},{"type":"audio/mpeg","href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2014/04/24/0418_eichner_p_128.mp3","meta":{"duration":576,"api":{"href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm_audio:/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2014/04/24/0418_eichner_p","type":"application/json"},"duration_hms":"00:09:36"},"format":"MP3"}]}
