Ungerer grew up in Alsace, France, during the World War II Nazi occupation.</p>\n<p>“I would’ve never turned to be what I have been, which is a champion for peace against facism, against violence, if I hadn’t been brainwashed by the Nazis,” Ungerer says.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"522\" width=\"750\" style=\"font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;\" alt=\"The Three Robbers\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/Three_Robbers_8-9.jpg\" title=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p> <em>The Three Robbers </em>by Tomi Ungerer</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Tomi Ungerer/ Phaidon</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>As a child, Ungerer was forced to join the Hitler Youth. During the occupation, French and the Alsace dialect were forbidden from being spoken. Ungerer remembers having to salute Hitler at the top of every hour when he was in school. </p>\n<p>“We kids would say 'Ein Little,' which means 'One, Little' instead of 'Heil Hitler,'” Ungerer recalls.</p>\n<p>That subversive attitude is something Ungerer has relished in throughout his career, even down the style that he cultivated as an illustrator harkens back to the propaganda of his youth.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"522\" width=\"750\" style=\"font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;\" alt=\"The Three Robbers\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/Three_Robbers_18-19.jpg\" title=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p><em>The Three Robbers</em> by Tomi Ungerer</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>“I was brought up under the best propaganda that was ever, ever produced — under [Joseph] Goebbels and the Nazis.

He has spent a good deal of his adult life advocating for education about the Holocaust in French schools. He made sure his own children visited the sites of concentration camps and atrocities in Alsace. Confronting the horrors of what happened is absolutely necessary, he says.\n<p>“My goodness, I see all kinds of absolutely abominable stuff on television and then those violent video games and then we avoid reality. No — reality is right there to be taught to children. I really do believe in that.”</p>\n<p>Ungerer, now 83, has a wide ranging retrospective of his work on display in New York City at <a href=\"http://www.artspace.com/tomi-ungerer/eat\">The Drawing Center</a>.</p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/Portrait_T.Ungerer%20%281%29.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/portraittungerer-1jpg"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/02112015_07.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0211201507mp3"}]}
