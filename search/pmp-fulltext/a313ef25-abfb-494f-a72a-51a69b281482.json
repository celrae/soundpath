They fall in love, and they fall out of love, and they get defeated in love — and he talks so eloquently on behalf of the young population,” he said.</p>\n<p>The news of Pashaei's cancer came only last year, shocking his fans.

His fans began closely following news about his health.</p>\n<p>\"We took him as a friend, as a brother that we never had, that is dealing with this — and is dealing with it in such a brave manner,\" Moazzami recalled. \"So [he] definitely sat very close to all Iranians' hearts.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"tweetdeck\"><p>مراسم تشییع <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AA%D8%B6%DB%8C?src=hash\">#مرتضی</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D9%BE%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C?src=hash\">#پاشایی</a> :( امروز 93/8/25 روحش شاد <a href=\"http://t.co/UhCllsJHDp\">pic.twitter.com/UhCllsJHDp</a></p>\n<p>— sarina_gh ▲ (@sarina_gh) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarina_gh/status/534065944566329344\">November 16, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>On Friday, those hearts were broken by the news of Pashaei’s death. Thousands came out to say farewell, holding candles as they chanted his songs.
