Goodness knows pop music needs some clever fun.</p><p>The three women in The Prettiots — Kay Kasparhauser on ukulele and lead vocals, Rachel Trachtenburg from the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players on drums, and bassist Lulu Prat — share their love of everything from <em>Law & Order</em> to old-school girl groups like the Shangri-Las. Their song \"Stabler,\" performed here, is based on Kasparhauser's infatuation with the <em>Law & Order</em> character Elliot Stabler.</p><p>\"Boys (I Dated In High School)\" is the Prettiots tune that first charmed me, thanks mainly to the perfect portrait its brainy rhymes paint:</p><blockquote><p><em>Martin, that was your name</em></p><p><em>I met you on the 1 train</em></p><p><em>You were super duper duper hot </em></p><p><em>On the 1 train</em></p><p><em>You said you were a painter</em></p><p><em>Mostly you were a waiter</em></p><p><em>A stoner and a skater </em></p><p><em>So I had to say later, </em></p><p><em>These are the boys that I dated in high school</em></p><p><em>I thought they were so nice </em></p><p><em>And I thought they were so cool</em></p><p><em>These are the boys that I dated in high school</em></p><p><em>They weren't very nice </em></p><p><em>And they weren't very cool</em></p></blockquote><p>It's the sort of music you'll either adore or abhor; it's hard to be neutral and you'll know it quickly.
