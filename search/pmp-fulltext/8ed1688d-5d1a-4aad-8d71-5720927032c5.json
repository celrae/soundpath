Kelly grabbed a few of those, from London to New York, and what he calls a mega-trip from London to Sydney. </p>\n<p>All told, Kelley said he paid about $1600 for flights that should have cost $59,862.</p>\n<p>\"You know, my attitude is, 'let's get in and if the airline honors it, great, if not then it was a fun rush for the morning.' It got me going yesterday,\" Kelly said.</p>\n<p>United Airlines has told Kelly and the others who got in on the deal to hold off from packing their bags.</p>\n<p>They'll get their money back — rather than seats. In a statement Wednesday, United said it wasn't going to honor the tickets for several thousand individuals who were \"attempting to take advantage of an error a third-party software provider made.\" </p>\n<p>United does have a point. Ticket buyers outside of Denmark — and there were a lot of them — really had to do some online finagling to get these deals.</p>\n<p>But Kelly said he still doesn't feel a bit sorry for the airline.</p>\n<p>\"Frankly, from a consumers perspective, United has made monumental mistakes that hurt the consumer and hasn't made good on them in the past. So I don't feel too badly for United, they're a pretty customer Un-friendly airline,\" he says, poking fun at United's current \"<a href=\"https://hub.united.com/en-us/flyerfriendly/pages/default.aspx\">Flyer Friendly</a>\" advertising scheme. \"I don't feel like they have to honor this, necessarily, but I don't really feel too bad, especially because they're coming out swinging here when, frankly, they should invest in better IT.\"</p>\n<p>Consumers who want to swing back can file a complaint with the US Department of Transportation. Airlines have been forced to honor previous so-called mistake fares because a specific federal reglation, Code of Federal Regulations number § 399.88, requires airlines to honor any ticket that has been paid for and issued. Whether that specific regulation will apply in this case is unclear — but many frequent fliers who bought these cheap tickets have vowed to find out.</p>\n<p>United's lawyers will likely be wrangling with the DOT for some time.</p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-02-12%2Fcomputer-glitch-screaming-deal-and-dot&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/UnitedTixFeature.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/unitedtixfeaturejpg"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0212201507.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0212201507mp3"}]}
