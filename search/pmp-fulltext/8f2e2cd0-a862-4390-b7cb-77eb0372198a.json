These are the moments when everything seems to click, and people leap forward into their careers</em><em>.</em></p><p>When he first moved to Los Angeles, he worked as a garbage truck driver.</p><p>He's acted in Westerns alongside John Wayne — even though he couldn't ride a horse.</p><p>His big break was acting in Dos Equis beer commercials.</p><p>He is Jonathan Goldsmith ... the actor who plays \"The Most Interesting Man in the World.\"</p><p>As it turns out, Goldsmith is pretty interesting himself.</p><p>The garbage truck driver-turned-Hollywood actor got his start with small parts in western movies.</p><p>\"It wasn't easy,\" Goldsmith says. \"Jewish boys that grow up in New York are not that adept at riding horses.\"</p><p>He lied his way into a part on the TV show, <em>Gunsmoke</em>. After director Marc Daniels hired him for a role on the show, he asked Goldsmith if he could ride a horse.</p><p>\"I say, 'Like the wind, sir, without breaking stride.' Well, I had never been on a horse in my life,\" Goldsmith says.</p><p>When he glanced at the script, he realized he was in trouble. In Goldsmith's scene, he was supposed to vault on horseback and gallop into the night.</p><p>\"As soon as I got on — the horses know,\" he says. \"Off he went. Everyone's screaming at me, 'Turn him, turn him around.' Well, I think I'm breaking the poor horse's neck ... Every time we went round and round this wonderful, old director Marc Daniels, he looked at me, followed me, [and he] says, 'Like the wind, huh?' \"</p><p>He stuck with westerns for a while, from a small part in <em>The Shootist</em> with John Wayne to <em>Hang 'Em High</em> with Clint Eastwood. In later film and television appearances, Goldsmith says he was typecast as the villain.</p><p>\"All I ever wanted to do was comedy, but that was not available to me,\" he says. \"Until the Dos Equis commercials.\"</p><p>It was at a time when Goldsmith was trying to resurrect his film career. He had left the industry and was working in the business world when he received a call from his then-agent, now wife, Barbara.</p><p>She suggested he try out for a commercial, playing a \"Hemingway-ish character.\" It would be improvised and he'd have to end with the sentence, \"And that's how I arm wrestled Fidel Castro.\"</p><p>He arrived at the audition and, to his surprise, was surrounded by hundreds of young, Latino actors.</p><p>\"The line is out into the street. And I said, 'Oh boy,' \" Goldsmith says. \"If they're looking at these Latino guys, I better put on an accent.\"</p><p>The voice of the late Argentine-born actor, Fernando Lamas, instantly popped into his head. The two were sailing buddies and good friends, and Goldsmith had perfected an impression of him.</p><p>\"So I thought about him and how funny he was and how charming and a great raconteur, so I put on my best Fernando imitation,\" Goldsmith says. \"And they started laughing.\"</p><p>Barbara received a call from Joe Blake, the casting director. He told Barbara that they loved Goldsmith's performance, but they felt like they had to go younger.</p><p>\"And in her infinite wisdom, she took a long pause and she said, 'Joe, how can the most interesting man in the world be young?' He said, 'I'll get back to you.' \"</p><p>Soon after, the casting director called back. He got the part. It was Goldsmith's big break.</p><p>\"At a time where many of my friends who have had far more credits than I have, were in the twilight of their career, it just started for me,\" he says.</p><p>\"It only took 50 years. An overnight success.\"</p><p><em><em>We want to hear about </em>your<em> big break. Send us an email at mybigbreak@npr.org.</em></em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
