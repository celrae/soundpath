But no one disputes that veteran suicide rates are rising far too quickly.</p>\n<p>Guttenfelder teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.mission22.com/\">Mission 22</a>, an advocacy campaign to raise awareness about the high rate of suicide among veterans. Their slogan is stark: \"The American Military's Deadliest Battleground Isn't Some Remote Stretch of Desert Across the Globe. It's Here at Home.\"</p>\n<p>Guttenfelder visited with five families who had lost a loved one to suicide.</p>\n<p>“I went to these homes to meet the families and to photograph the spaces where these suicides happened, and to try to give meaning to this different kind of battlefield,\" he says \"But most of the time when I was there I wasn’t taking pictures. I was sitting on their couches and talking about their sons and trying to help them understand.”</p>\n<p>Here are some of the photos Guttenfelder took at the homes of these veterans.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-original_image\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/locF21_WEB.jpg?itok=usOBeSW8\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Clay Ward's garage. Ward was deployed to Iraq. His wife Sabine Ward stood by his side as he struggled to adjust to civilian life. He was diagnosed with PTSD and haunted by what he'd been through while at war. When it grew overwhelming, he took his gun, waded into the pool behind their house, and pulled the trigger. A year later, his wife Sabine tried to finish a bottle of pills he had left behind.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>David Guttenfelder</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-original_image\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/locF17_WEB.jpg?itok=GfSfh37g\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>The pool where Veteran Clay Ward took his life.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>David Guttenfelder</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-original_image\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/locE07_WEB.jpg?itok=Bt9bKKtv\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Brandon Ladner.

Panama City, Florida. Busbee enlisted after high school. He was Army Special Forces deployed to Afghanistan’s Pech Valley. His convoy was attacked on a road winding through Afghanistan. The brain injuries he sustained led to his honorable discharge. He went back to America struggling with PTSD and TBI. On March 20, 2012, William texted his mother, Libby, and told her he loved her. Fearing this was a goodbye, Libby and William's two young sisters sped home. They found him sitting in his brand new Dodge Charger in the carport. He had a gun and was surrounded by police. Libby stood with her daughters, powerless, and pleaded with the officers to let her approach her son.
