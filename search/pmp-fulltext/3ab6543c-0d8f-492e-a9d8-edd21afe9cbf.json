This means, of course, that he must be there to witness those deaths.</p><p>This past week, after an execution in Oklahoma went terribly wrong, many people turned their attention again to capital punishment â€” and to the reporters who cover it. Graczyk is no stranger to botched executions himself, having witnessed at least two in his time reporting.</p><p>There are peculiar difficulties that come with covering such grim events for his livelihood.</p><p>One of the challenges: Despite viewing so many executions, Graczyk tries to maintain a sense of his responsibilities as a witness to the death of another individual.</p><p>\"You have to be careful,\" he says. \"You don't want to get into a formula. You want to make it a story that people want to read, either for the record or for the sake of it being an interesting case.\"</p><p>And still, even in the trying moment, he must remember his faculties as a reporter. \"As [with] most people who write news stories, you're dealing with time and space considerations, and you want to be careful that you don't miss anything.\"</p><p>Matter-of-factly, he notes: \"It can be very challenging at times.\"</p><p><strong>Join our Sunday conversation</strong></p><p>Have your views on the death penalty changed over time?
