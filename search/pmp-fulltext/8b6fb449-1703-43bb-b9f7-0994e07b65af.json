And sometimes it wasn't even to perform a wedding, but to sing 'Hallelujah.'\"</p>\n<p>Kelly admits that reworking \"Hallelujah,\" which has become <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/12/how-leonard-cohens-hallelujah-became-everybodys-hallelujah/265900/\">a kind of ubiquitous anthem </a>over the past three decades, was first brought to his attention at another wedding he officiated seven or eight years ago.</p>\n<p>\"This little girl — she was a bridesmaid — was about 10 and she started singing Leonard Cohen's song 'Hallelujah' with the words changed to suit the bride and groom,\" he says. \"At the end of the service I went over to her and asked for a copy of the words and she gave me a copy. And, as I found out afterwards, she actually wrote the words herself for that particular wedding with the help of her mom and dad.\"</p>\n<p>So it was that 10-year-old girl <em>and</em> Leonard Cohen who helped <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6443484/father-ray-kelly-youtube-priesthood\">launch Kelly's singing career</a>. The 61-year-old priest has signed a deal with a major American label, Universal Music Group, which just released <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Where-Belong-Father-Ray-Kelly/dp/B00SOPOS06/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427727243&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Father+Ray+Kelly\">his debut CD</a>.
