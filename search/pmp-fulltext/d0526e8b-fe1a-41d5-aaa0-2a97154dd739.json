It’s tucked away between a few nondescript shops. But it opens into a hidden world. Women in the Philippines have been coming here for years to get affordable birth control, something frowned upon in this largely conservative Catholic country.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is the Likhaan Family Clinic, and it’s packed — not just with women these days, but men as well. Twenty-six-year-old Analesa Paluga stands in the small, cramped waiting area with her husband and young son by her side. Paluga says they’ve had two unintended pregnancies, since they didn’t know about contraceptives until they heard about Likhaan.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That’s not surprising, says the founder of Likhaan, Dr. Junice Melgar. When she opened the clinic 20 years ago, “Contraceptive pills were considered almost like contraband that had to be hidden, because if local city officials would see them, [people with contraceptives] would be accosted,” she says.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There was actually a ban on contraceptives in Manila’s public health clinics. <a href=\"http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-01-22/catholic-leaders-battle-against-free-birth-control-philippines\">A new law </a>recently upheld by the Philippines’ Supreme Court nullified the ban, but while those changes roll out, this clinic is still the go-to place for contraception among the poor here.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-story_image\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_main/public/soniamama_12.jpg?itok=r9dyxT5Z\" width=\"937\" height=\"552\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Lina Bacalando addresses folk myths about artificial birth control to a packed room of men and women at a Likhaan clinic.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Sonia Narang</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Melgar didn’t set out to focus on contraception. In medical school, she decided she wanted to work in poor communities, so she began a program to treat women with tuberculosis, malnutrition, and other diseases. But she realized they needed more.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“The number of women who were seeking contraceptives became like 60 percent of our patient load,” she says.</p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_border cta_align-left cta_icon-engagement cta_bg-blue\" data-entity-id=\"76678\" data-entity-title=\" Get involved Family Planning\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-76678\" class=\"node node-story-act contextual-links-region story-act-cta story-act-nid-76678 cta-type-external-link clearfix\" about=\"/node/76678\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/76678\">Story Act: Get involved Family Planning</a></h2>\n<div class=\"contextual-links-wrapper\">\n<ul class=\"contextual-links\"><li class=\"node-edit first\"><a href=\"/node/76678/edit?destination=node/72046/moderation\">Edit</a></li>\n<li class=\"node-delete last\"><a href=\"/node/76678/delete?destination=node/72046/moderation\">Delete</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p><span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Story Act: Get involved Family Planning\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    Get involved w/the source  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-image\">\n    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/likhaan_logo.png?itok=Ovs0Ft7u\" width=\"100\" height=\"47\" /></div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-teaser\">\n    You can look closer at the data and people guiding the work of the Likhaan Center for Family Health in the Philippines, or even volunteer to be part of it, by checking out its resource page.  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-external-link\">\n    <a href=\"http://likhaan.org/sites/default/files/likhaan_brochure_2013.pdf\">Go beyond the story</a>  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But to do that, in its early days Likhaan had to open family planning clinics in cities surrounding Manila. They then arranged to transport women to those areas. The group distributed free contraceptives, with support from the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and the European Union.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Demystifying the IUD</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Likhaan does more than provide contraception—it helps address folk myths about artificial birth control, fears that pills can pile up in the womb, or that interuterine devices can hurt men or make them infertile.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Upstairs from the clinic's entrance, men and women pack a workshop with Lina Bacalando, known around here as “Mama Lina.” Her fun, energetic teaching style makes everyone in the room laugh.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"506\" width=\"900\" alt=\"Likhaan 2\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/Sonia%20Narang_Likhaan_MamaLina2.jpg?itok=6ueZ4QGQ\" title=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Lina Bacalando teaches a family planning workshop to a packed room of women from the nearby area. </p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Sonia Narang</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bacalando passes around an IUD, a T-shaped intrauterine device that can prevent pregnancies for up to seven years. She knows that with the couples here, it’s the men who are more afraid. So, she teaches them how it works.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“I make them hold the device, especially the guys,” Bacalando says. “So I’m able to convince them that it’s actually just plastic, that it’s soft, so you won’t get hurt and that it’s inserted in the womb so you won’t hit it. We’re able to correct some of their misconceptions.”</p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_no_border cta_align-left cta_no-icon cta_bg-white\" data-entity-id=\"76845\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-76845\" class=\"node node-story-act contextual-links-region story-act-cta story-act-nid-76845 cta-type-custom-text clearfix\" about=\"/node/76845\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/76845\">Story Act Infographic philippines</a></h2>\n<div class=\"contextual-links-wrapper\">\n<ul class=\"contextual-links\"><li class=\"node-edit first\"><a href=\"/node/76845/edit?destination=node/72046/moderation\">Edit</a></li>\n<li class=\"node-delete last\"><a href=\"/node/76845/delete?destination=node/72046/moderation\">Delete</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p><span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Story Act Infographic philippines\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-body\">\n\n<div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"310\" width=\"294\" alt=\"unintendedpreg\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/unintendedpregFINAL.jpg?itok=EYAZlhm5\" title=\"\" /><span class=\"field-label\"><br />\n    Credit:<br /></span>\n<div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n<p>David Conrad</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like many of the women in the room, Bacalando was born and raised in a low-income area, where people don’t have enough money to buy birth control.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bacalando says her parents came from big families. Her mom was one of 18 siblings. None of them finished high school. So when she got married, she decided she only wanted two children.  </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Likhaan taught me that I have rights,” she says. “I learned that I can negotiate with my husband how many kids we should have and what kinds of family planning tools we can use.”  </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many reproductive health activists believe the NGO’s work led to a seismic shift in cultural attitudes. It’s certainly obvious when talking with the young women here like Analesa Paluga. As she waits for her number to be called in the exam area, she says she’s here today to get a free birth control implant, in the form of a small plastic rod the size of a matchstick. It releases the hormone progestin, which suppresses ovulation and can prevent pregnancies for up to three years.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Paluga echoes Mama Lina in saying birth control is crucial not just for her, but her family.</p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_border cta_align-left cta_icon-engagement cta_bg-gray\" data-entity-id=\"76484\" data-entity-title=\" Follow Across Women's Lives\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-76484\" class=\"node node-story-act contextual-links-region story-act-cta story-act-nid-76484 cta-type-external-link cta-style-share clearfix\" about=\"/node/76484\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/76484\">Story Act: Follow Across Women's Lives</a></h2>\n<div class=\"contextual-links-wrapper\">\n<ul class=\"contextual-links\"><li class=\"node-edit first\"><a href=\"/node/76484/edit?destination=node/72046/moderation\">Edit</a></li>\n<li class=\"node-delete last\"><a href=\"/node/76484/delete?destination=node/72046/moderation\">Delete</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p><span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Story Act: Follow Across Women's Lives\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    Across Women's LIves  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-image\">\n    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/awl_logo3.png?itok=i09uvaLD\" width=\"100\" height=\"63\" /></div>\n<div class=\"field-body\">\n<p>Follow us on Twitter @womenslives and #womenslives</p>\n<p>Or join the conversation on the Across Women's Lives <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/833763303311433/\">Facebook page</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“For my kids, what I want is, that no matter what, I’m going to raise them so that they study and they graduate,” she says, “so that the family they have isn’t like the one I grew up in — it’s better.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Soon, Paluga’s number is called.
