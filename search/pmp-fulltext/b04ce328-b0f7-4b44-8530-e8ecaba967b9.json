She notes that a lot of families of children with special healthcare needs face a dilemma – how to qualify for Medicaid after leaving the hospital, a point at which coverage usually stops. Some families, she says, go to great lengths to ensure that they continue to qualify.</p>\n<p>“Families will rearrange their finances and make changes so that they never make anything more than what they’re allowed to make and still qualify for services,\" Goyer says. \"Some families with special needs are really faced with the choice – how do I live my life, just at the right level of poverty so that we get the health care coverage we need?”</p>\n<p>But Goyer is also Megan Wood’s sister, and she says she understands how and why the NPA’s suggestion to transfer just one embryo at time is tough. Emotionally, she understands why families use more. But clinically, she says the safest choice is transferring just one embryo at a time.</p>\n<p>A lot of ethical decisions, says Goyer, about in vitro fertilization need to be discussed.</p>\n<p>“And at this point,” she notes, “those decisions are being made by the marketplace.”</p>\n<p>Miriam Zoll, a health and reproductive rights advocate, and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Cracked-Open-Liberty-Fertility-Pursuit/dp/1566569230\" target=\"_blank\">Cracked Open: Liberty, Fertility and the Pursuit of High Tech Babies</a>, says part of the blame for transferring too many embryos is due to a different kind of financial pressure.

Some in the medical industry set rates far higher than necessary, seeking to tap into fearful patients desperate to conceive and willing to pay.
