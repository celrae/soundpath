We'll also hear an essay from a Mexican student who was raised in Denver but is back in Mexico for college. He talks about what it's like to be openly gay there. We've also got the story of a new, and very dangerous drug that's caught on in Russia. It's known as \"The Spice,\" and the main ingredient is, believe it or not, bath salts. And we'll say farewell to Leonard Nimoy, who inspired millions as the logical — and different —character of Mr. Spock on 'Star Trek.'<img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pri/theworld/~4/9vIM9IRjUas\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","itags":["npr_api","389641284"],"contentencoded":"<p><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 MPX.
