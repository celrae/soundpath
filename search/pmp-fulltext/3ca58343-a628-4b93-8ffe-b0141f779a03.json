But since he couldn&#8217;t get his boot cast into a hazmat suit, he came up with another idea.</p><p>As a professor at Columbia University&#8217;s Mailman School of Public Health, he teamed up with Columbia&#8217;s School of Engineering and Applied Science to launch a challenge for students, faculty and alumni: develop a low-cost technology-driven solution to the many problems caused by Ebola &#8212; in two weeks. By low cost, Lipkin meant $150 or less.</p><p>The results, as Lipkin anticipated, are impressive. Among the finalists are bleach foam for decontamination, colored bleach to see whether every surface has been sprayed and a full body, breathable, cooled, Ebola containment suit that includes a hydration system and a form of diaper.
