The phrase means \"confused\" or \"convoluted.\"</p><p>\"There's another word that you might use which is <em>mecha kucha,</em>\" Knight added. \"<em>Mecha kucha</em> means, roughly, 'messed up.' <em>Mecha kucha</em> is more slang, so it probably has a little stronger feel to it.\"</p><p>Australian trade negotiators might substitute the slang term \"ballsed up,\" while Spanish speakers from Chile, Mexico or Peru might use a word like <em>bodrio</em>.</p><p>Snafu, of course, is military slang from World War II â€” an acronym for \"Situation Normal, All [let's say Fouled] Up.\"</p><p>Implicit in snafu is a uniquely American nonchalance. The sense that fouled up situations are nothing out of the ordinary isn't easy to translate.</p><p>\"I don't think 'snafu' or even the concept has made its way into the Japanese culture,\" Knight said.</p><p>He points to another useful Japanese phrase, though: <em>wabi sabi</em>. It refers to an appreciation of imperfection, in a work of art, or perhaps the U.S. Congress.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
