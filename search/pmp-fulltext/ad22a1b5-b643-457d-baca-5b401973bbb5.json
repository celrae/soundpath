And the whole map of the Middle East may be in play.  We’ll take a cold, hard look.</p><p>Days into the onslaught of black-clad fighters in Iraq, the news is still stunning.  The map of Iraq – where the US invaded, spent billions, trillions, lost 4000 lives – redrawn in less than a week. City after city lost to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a group more than dreaming now of an Islamic “caliphate” stretching from Aleppo to Iran, beyond.  A fantasy before the US invasion.  Now a region of turmoil you can draw on the map.  This hour On Point:  Iraq, coming apart right now at the seams.  America’s options.  The facts on the ground.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: right\"><strong>&#8211; Tom Ashbrook</strong></p><h4>Guests</h4><p><a title=\"Reuters Ned Parker\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/places/iraq\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Ned Parker</strong></a>, Baghdad bureau chief for <em>Reuters</em>.

With fewer than 10,000 fighters ISIS forced the retreat of the better-armed Iraqi army forces many times its size. Their incredible success on the battlefield has fed into a growing lore about the group: the small band of fanatics that can take down a country. The truth is more basic and it’s something ISIS doesn’t want to admit—they weren’t acting alone.&#8221;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 WBUR-FM.
