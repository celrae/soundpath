And, though I said no — dear coworkers, I really do care about you — the band still brought a fun mix of brass and brash to the Tiny Desk.</p><p>At the front of this band is Kalmia Traver and Alex Toth; she sings clever words, straps a tambourine to her foot and plays the flute, while he plays trumpet, flute and more. I really like this band and its attitude — party-friendly but with a serious side, perhaps informed by Traver's recent battle with cancer — which comes through nicely on Rubblebucket's new album, <em>Survival Sounds. </em>So set aside a few minutes to take this little carousel ride, courtesy of a band like few others.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"Carousel Ride\"</li><li>\"On The Ground\"</li><li>\"Sound Of Erasing\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Maggie Starbard; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Colin Marshall, Maggie Starbard, Susan Hale Thomas; Assistant Producer: Susannah Whittle; photo by Susan Hale Thomas/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
