Maintaining the dozen or so bases that give Russia access to the Black and Mediterannean Seas is one of the main motivations for the country's military posturing. In exchange for maintaining the bases, Ukraine recieves a discount on oil and gas imports from Russia.

About 80 percent of that comes through pipelines in Ukraine. With the E.U. still recovering from its economic crisis, the threat of a cut-off gives Russia leverage. Russia also provides about half of Ukraine's natural gas, and has used cut-offs in the past to exert pressure on its government. The U.S. only gets a little gas and oil from Russia (5 percent), but any disruption as a result of cut-offs or sanctions could still make our fuel prices rise.

That's already down about 16 percent from last year. Ukraine has historically been a breadbasket in the region, growing mostly wheat and corn that's then shipped to 37 countries around the world. Grain accounts for 25 percent of the country's exports and five percent of their GDP.

If the country doesn't get help paying that off, either from Russia or the E.U., they are likely headed for default. After the ouster of key Russian-aligned officials in Ukraine, Moscow froze its $15 billion bailout package and a serious alternative is yet to be put on the table. The International Monetary Fund has provided a glimmer of hope with word of raising funds for Ukraine, but the country needs to reestablish stability before they could get it.
