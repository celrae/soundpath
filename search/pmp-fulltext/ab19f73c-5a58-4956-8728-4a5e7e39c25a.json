Some, like the beautiful albums by Beck and Luluc, made an impression while keeping the volume low; others, including the sophomore album from the hip-hop duo <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/250227134/run-the-jewels\" target=\"_blank\">Run The Jewels</a>,<em> </em>made a noise that was impossible to turn down once it arrived like a buzzsaw in October. And then there are the pop juggernauts who bookended the year: <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/19230778/beyonce\" target=\"_blank\">Beyonc√©</a>, whose self-titled album came out late in 2013 but echoed through most of this year, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/10/30/360129727/the-many-new-voices-of-taylor-swift\" target=\"_blank\">Taylor Swift</a>, who wiped the floor (sales-wise, at least) with every other album released in 2014.</p><p>This is just the beginning of our year-end extravaganza.
