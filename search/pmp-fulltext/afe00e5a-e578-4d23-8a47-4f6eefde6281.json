The 15-year old is tiny, just 3 foot 8, 66 pounds. She can’t speak and she struggles with lung disease that can turn a simple cold into a life-threatening event. Since Leta was born, her parents Rick and Lainey and an army of doctors have searched for the cause of her condition.

The possibilities are as much as we can imagine them,” says Krantz.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis is a genuine breakthrough -- it’s not a <em>cure</em> for her daughter. Lainey Moseley says it’s a <em>different</em> kind of gift.</p>\n<p>“I had always felt personally guilty that doubt, well did I do something wrong in my pregnancy. Did I cause this? And finding this diagnosis in some ways let me off the hook a little bit. It wasn’t my fault,” she says.</p>\n<p>The sheer power of DNA sequencing has top hospitals falling over themselves investing tens of millions of dollars to get into this business. <a href=\"http://www.med.upenn.edu/micro/faculty/doms.html\">Dr. Robert Doms</a> says his bosses at CHOP didn’t blink when he submitted his business plan to set up a DNA sequencing center.</p>\n<p>“I think they cut one secretary, but otherwise, otherwise they gave me everything I ask for. Of course, now I have to be successful,” he says.</p>\n<p>Success here in Philadelphia means that within a year, CHOP will have a genetics team of 50.

Cortizas says hospitals are scrambling to develop the fastest, cheapest test out there.</p>\n<p>“This is a race to who does this best, but what does best mean?” she asks. “Is it the cheapest sequencing, the fastest sequencing or the sequencing that is most useful for the patients?”</p>\n<p>While the market for these tests is emerging, hospitals face challenges. <a href=\"http://www.choc.org/findadoc/index.cfm?id=P00348&amp;pid=67\">Dr. Leonard Sender</a> is the director of the Genomic Center at <a href=\"http://www.choc.org/specialties/index.cfm?id=P00428\">Children’s Hospital of Orange County</a>.
