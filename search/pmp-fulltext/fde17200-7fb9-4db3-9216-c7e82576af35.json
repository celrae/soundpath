Soul singer <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15402548/anthony-hamilton\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Hamilton</a> wanted to try it out, but he was wary of falling into cliché and repeating the formulas that have shaped holiday records for years.</p><p>\"The mundane songs that have been recorded over and over again, I really didn't want to do that,\" he says. \"I didn't want it to be so sterile that you couldn't feel the personality. And I wanted it to be true to who I am as an artist.\"</p><p>To pull that off on his first Christmas album, <em>Home for the Holidays</em>, Hamilton thought about where he'd come from, and applied it to the music. Instead of a traditional arrangement for \"The Little Drummer Boy,\" he told producer Kelvin Wooten, \"Let's put a little <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15182634/outkast\" target=\"_blank\">Outkast</a> to it.\" And for the title track, he called in a friend — singer Gavin DeGraw — to add a different flavor to the music.</p><p>Alongside time-honored tunes and a half-dozen originals, the album also makes some new nominations for the holiday music canon. Among the standout tracks is a cover of the 1968 <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15316566/james-brown\" target=\"_blank\">James Brown</a> number \"Santa Claus Go Straight to the Ghetto.\"</p><p>\"Being someone from the ghetto, from the inner city, and from those streets, I felt like it was just a way of introducing a new sound to my people, and those who wouldn't normally embrace a Christmas album,\" Hamilton says. \"Like, hey, it's all right. It's OK to get into the spirit.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
