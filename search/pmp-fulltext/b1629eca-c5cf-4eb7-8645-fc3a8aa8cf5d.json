Saturday at 9:26:53 is the big moment.</p><p>Pi has perplexed and puzzled mathematicians for millennia. We learn it in school as having something to do with circles, but it turns up as the solution to lots of other problems, even when there are no circles involved.</p><p><strong>Matt Parker</strong> is a mathematician at Queen Mary University in London.

Everywhere you look in math, suddenly pi will leap out of the shadows.&#8221;</p><p>For example, if you take all of the odd fractions: 1/3, 1/5, 1/7 and so on, &#8220;if you start with 1 and subtract and add the fractions, so 1 minus 1/3 plus 1/5 minus 1/7, if you carry on, the total you get is a quarter of pi. And if you add every single fraction together, 1, 1/2, 1/3 , all them, but you square them, you get pi squared divided by 6. So suddenly, everywhere you go in math, pi is there. And that’s why mathematicians get so obsessed with it.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r3cEKZiLmg\">[Youtube]</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNiRzZ66YN0\">[Youtube]</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngj0a57Rlb0\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://standupmaths.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Matt Parker</strong></a>, mathematician at Queen Mary University in London, stand-up math comic and author of the book &#8220;Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension.&#8221;</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
