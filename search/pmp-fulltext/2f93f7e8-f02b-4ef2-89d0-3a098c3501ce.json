'That changes starting today.'\"</p></blockquote><p>This morning, Northwest News Network's Chris Lehman <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/02/18/387125614/oregon-ushers-one-governor-out-another-one-in-on-wednesday\">filed a profile of Brown for Morning Edition</a>. Chris reported:</p><blockquote><p>\"Brown is far from a political enigma in Oregon. She served in the state legislature for 17 years before getting elected to statewide office in 2008.</p><p>\"'Kate Brown is seen as much more of a classic Democrat,' says Jim Moore, who teaches political science at Pacific University in Forest Grove, Ore. 'She is seen as further to the left. So she does not tend to cross the public employee unions. Big on environmental things. Not known for compromising with Republicans during her time in the legislative.'\"</p></blockquote><p>Brown will have to run for governor in 2016, if she wants to serve out Kitzhaber's original four-year term.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
