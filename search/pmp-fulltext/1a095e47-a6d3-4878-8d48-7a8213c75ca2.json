These are just a few of the questions that popped up during our <em>All Songs Considered</em> listening party in Boston last week.</p><p><em>All Songs Considered</em> host Bob Boilen and NPR Music's Stephen Thompson were joined by a panel of guests — musicologist and engineer Susan Rogers, <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com\"><em>Boston Globe</em></a> music critic James Reed and Amelia Mason, writer for <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org\" target=\"_blank\">WBUR</a>'s <a href=\"http://artery.wbur.org\" target=\"_blank\">The ARTery</a> — to play songs for a live audience and attempt to unspool the myriad ways that music makes us feel. Members of the audience were invited to rate the music on a scale of 1 to 10 with numbered cards. And, invariably, a passionate discussion followed over why the music did or didn't resonate.</p><p>We recorded the whole thing so you can experience it for yourself.
