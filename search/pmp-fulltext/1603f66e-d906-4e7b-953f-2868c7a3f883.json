Guaranteed paid maternity leave? Fourteen weeks in Germany. 35 in Norway. 52 in Britain. The US? Zero. Wages paid during maternity leave by law? One hundred percent in New Zealand. In Portugal. In Austria. In Spain. And the US? Again, zero. Then there’s flextime, childcare and all the rest. The White House is now campaigning on the theme.
