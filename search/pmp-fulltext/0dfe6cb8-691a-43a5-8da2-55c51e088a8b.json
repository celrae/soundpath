And rural America has its deep roots, and, I think, great values. I said to a man in Aiken, South Carolina, &#8216;I&#8217;m a stranger.&#8217; He said, &#8216;You&#8217;re not a stranger, there ain&#8217;t no strangers here.&#8217; And a woman said the same thing to me in Tuscaloosa [Alabama]. &#8216;I&#8217;m a stranger.&#8217; She said &#8216;You&#8217;re not a stranger, there are no strangers here.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p><strong>On visiting the infamous Bryant&#8217;s Grocery in Money, Miss.</strong></p><p>&#8220;Bryant&#8217;s Store where Emmett Till met his doom, is still standing. It&#8217;s on a crossroads. Money, Mississippi, is a back road, there&#8217;s a railway running through it. Train doesn&#8217;t stop. The walls are crumbling, there are vines and roots sort of holding it together. They don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s a monument, a horror &#8212; it&#8217;s a haunted building. And Money, Mississippi, is a very tiny place. I doubt there are two dozen people who live there.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On unexpected encounters in the Delta</strong></p><p>&#8220;I was in the Delta, in the town of Greenville [Mississippi] in the Delta. And I must say, the Delta is a very poor place &#8212; poor in money, great in spirit. I was asking a lady about the B.B. King Museum and this woman&#8217;s colleague said, &#8216;Should we tell him?&#8217;And she said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know.&#8217; And the [colleague] said, &#8216;This is B.B. King&#8217;s ex-wife.&#8217; His last wife! Most recent wife. So we talked about B.B. King.&#8221;</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.paultheroux.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fan website dedicated to Paul Theroux</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=242736488\" target=\"_blank\">Hear Weekend Edition&#8217;s interview with Theroux ahead thisÂ trip</a></li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/author/paul-theroux/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Theroux</a></strong>, travel writer and novelist.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
