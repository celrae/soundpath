The justices sided with the Obama administration in ruling that immigration laws do not let children who age out of the system qualify for visas.</p><p>The court also ruled that a group of homeowners in North Carolina can&#8217;t sue a company that contaminated their drinking water because a state deadline has lapsed. The justices ruled 7 to 2 on Monday that state law strictly bars any lawsuit brought more than 10 years after the contamination &#8212; even if residents did not realize their water was polluted until years later.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://emilybazelon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Emily Bazelon</a></strong>, senior editor for <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/authors.emily_bazelon.html\" target=\"_blank\">Slate</a> magazine and senior research fellow at Yale Law School.
