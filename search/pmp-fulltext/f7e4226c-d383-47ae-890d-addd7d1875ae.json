Maj. Lisa Torello was 5 years old when her dad, Sgt. 1st Class Carl Torello, was killed in Vietnam.</p><p>\"My dad was due to retire; he was two months short of 20 years,\" 55-year-old Lisa said during a visit to StoryCorps. \"So, he knew it was his last tour and he was gonna go home for good.\"</p><p>Lisa was joined by Tony Cistaro, a State Department employee at the time, who was the only survivor from the attack that killed the elder Torello. The two had just met the day before.</p><p>\"Your dad was very duty-bound. If he was passed over to go out in the field, he'd get animated about it,\" Cistaro said. \"And, uh, I was with your dad the day he was killed. We were going to travel through the province and make three stops. It was a winding road and as we were coming down the hill, which was the most dangerous spot. I turned and faced your father. We smiled and gave each other thumbs up; we made it. And the next thing I knew, I was thrown out of my seat and I was seeing sky. I realized then, my God, we've been blown up. <br /> <br />\"Your father was laying off to the side of the road and, he never regained consciousness,\" he continued. \"I know I was the last person your dad saw and I still see that smile on your father's face, one hand on the steering wheel, and that's how I remember your dad.\"</p><p>When they met, Cistaro, 85, told Lisa she had her dad's smile.</p><p>\"That just — I lost it,\" she said. \"My dad and I had this connection that was deeper than I even understood. And, within two months after graduating from high school, I left for basic training. And then, once I joined the Army, all I really wanted to do was to be his rank.</p><p>\"So, when I made my father's rank, as soon as the ceremony was over, I went to the bathroom and cried,\" Lisa said. \"And I was like, I did it. That was the most monumental thing that ever happened to me. I mean, I wanted to be exactly like him, and 31 years in the Army, I guess I am just like him.\"</p><p>Cistaro — who also told Lisa she was brave — said he visits her dad at the Vietnam Memorial wall each year. <br /> <br />\"Someone asked, 'Don't you want to forget?' And no. I'm happy I met you and I'm happy that I can help you understand more,\" he said. \"Yes, and I wanna say, your dad, his grin would be from ear to ear, you know that, to see you as you are now.\"<br /> <br /> Lisa replied: \"Thank you. I don't feel like he's ever left me, ever.\" <br /> <br /><em>Audio produced for </em>Morning Edition<em> by Jud Esty-Kendall.</em></p><p><em>StoryCorps is a national nonprofit that gives people the chance to interview friends and loved ones about their lives.
