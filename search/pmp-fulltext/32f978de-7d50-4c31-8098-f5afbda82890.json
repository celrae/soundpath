Vanya Shivashankar, 13, of Olathe, Kansas, and Gokul Venkatachalum, 14, of Chesterfield, Missouri, battled until the very end &#8211; sharing the coveted title.</p><p>Both winners are of South Asian descent, and during the finals, six of the remaining seven participants were also South Asian.</p><p>One anthropologist says there&#8217;s a reason for that. <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson spoke with Northwestern University professor <strong>Shalini Shankar</strong>, who has been studying South Asian dominance of spelling bee culture.</p><p>&#8220;I think that the activity of spelling bees has grown in prestige among certain South Asian-American communities,&#8221; Shankar said. &#8220;I would say that it&#8217;s not a uniform phenomenon among South Asian-American communities, but among those that do value this activity, they&#8217;ve really taken to it and they compete year round in different spelling bee circuits.&#8221;</p><p>So what kind of preparation goes into winning a national spelling bee? The short answer is, a lot. So much that Shivashankar says she has heard her winning word, scherenschnitte &#8211; a German word for the art of paper cutting &#8211; &#8220;a bunch of times.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;You cannot win a national championship of this caliber unless you really dedicate hours a day, probably year round.&#8221;<div class=\"pullquoteauth\">&ndash; Shalini Shankar</div></p><p></div></p><p>&#8220;You cannot win a national championship of this caliber unless you really dedicate hours a day, probably year round,&#8221; Shankar says. &#8220;They make lists out of Merriam-Webster&#8217;s Dictionary, which is probably why Vanya could say, &#8216;I&#8217;ve seen that word several times,&#8217; because they&#8217;re very thorough in their preparation. Additionally, they study root dictionaries of Latin roots, Greek roots and so on, and that really helps them decode words on the spot.&#8221;</p><p>That preparation can take a toll, Shankar says, especially after spellers have passed the age of 15, the maximum age for entering the national spelling bee.</p><p>&#8220;One speller I interviewed had a very clever phrase that she and others used, which was &#8216;PTSD&#8217; or &#8216;post-traumatic spelling disorder,&#8217; because they have spent an inordinate amount of time focusing on spelling, and many of them really miss it,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But because they have such active Facebook groups and Google groups, they do stay in touch with each other, and I think they continue to share their love of words with one another as they go through middle school and high school.&#8221;</p><p>Shankar says that while adjusting to life after spelling bees can be difficult, most spellers go on to college and into a wide variety of careers.</p><p>&#8220;I think they can do whatever they want,&#8221; she says. &#8220;They&#8217;re just so smart.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/shankar.html\" target=\"_blank\">Shalini Shankar</a></strong>, associate professor of anthropology and Asian American studies at Northwestern University.
