It is the best movie, and very little that we’ve seen since then has been as great, especially in the main competition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On the artistic direction of the movies being shown:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The financing for these movies has really compromised some of the artistic choices that a filmmaker can make.... You have money coming from all over the world, and it dictates certain things. Like, if you’re a Greek director and you’re getting Irish money, then you have to take Colin Farrell with the money you get, which happened. It happened at a movie this year!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On making movies in different languages:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are a number of other directors, maybe like six other directors, making movies for the first time or maybe the second time, not in their native language.

It’s not happening every night, but everybody’s got a story about how it happened to them or someone in their party …where you were denied entry because you were not appropriately dressed.
