The West and Ukraine say Russia is stoking dissent here. Moscow denies the claims and says Kiev needs to pull its troops back in order for there to be dialogue.\"</p></blockquote><p>The airport in Donetsk was shut down Tuesday, though officials did not provide a reason. From Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson spoke about the closure on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/05/06/309996969/ukrainian-troops-battle-pro-russian-insurgents\">Morning Edition</a>.</p><p>\"This probably has to do with the May 9 Victory Day, which is the celebration of the Soviet victory over the Nazis in World War II,\" Soraya says. \"That is expected to drive up more tensions, and they don't want more people showing up to agitate.\"</p><p>In addition to that date, two others are approaching that will surely increase tensions. On May 25, Ukraine will hold presidential elections, and on May 11, separatists plan to hold a referendum to decide whether to break away and join Russia, following the path of Crimea.</p><p>As <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/05/05/309713197/ukraine-dispatches-special-police-to-odessa-after-unrest\">we reported Monday</a>, Ukraine has also \"dispatched a special police unit to try to control the deadly clashes in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odessa.\"</p><p><strong>Update at 6:30 p.m. ET:</strong></p><p>Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27289897\">ruled out more talks to resolve the crisis</a>, saying there's not much use since an April accord between the U.S., EU and Russia was never implemented.</p><p>\"I don't think [another meeting] would have any added value â€” we would just go round in circles,\" Lavrov said.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
