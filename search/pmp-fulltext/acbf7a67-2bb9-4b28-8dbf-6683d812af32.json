Finkel says that's the danger with online dating, screening and money. People might think they know what they want but put the same group in a room together and pre-defined ideas, like Jasmine's, will fly right out the window.</p>\n<p>\"There's reason to believe that asking people what they want, is not the best way of getting at what they actually want,\" said Finkel.</p>\n<p>So if you're single, Finkel says don't try to pick your own online match -- you might miss out on your trombone player. Or you can just remember the most important question you can ask about money in a relationship -- is whether someone is willing to answer more questions about money in that relationship.</p></div>","title":"Finding the perfect money match online","itags":["Marketplace Money for Weekend of October 3-4, 2009","acbf7a672bb9b289dbff6683d812af32","PMP:Marketplace_PMP","Marketplace Money for Friday, June 28, 2013","Marketplace","Marketplace Money"],"teaser":"Can websites like eHarmony really help form the perfect union -- even when it comes to money?","contenttemplated":"[{\"content\":\"<p>Diane Oraif lives in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
