Laxman would capture it in his brush strokes in a way that was captivating and that allowed you to then navigate the finer details of the news through the prose of the newspaper.\"\n<p>Khanduri is now an academic who writes about the impact of political cartoons on Indian history. She interviewed Laxman, now 93, for her new book <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2014/11/Khanduri-Cartoons-Politics.php\">Caricaturing Culture in India: Cartoons and History in the Modern World</a>.

So there's this gap between what is aspired for and what is actually happening at the ground level.\"</p>\n<p>Khanduri says Laxman's cartoons animated this gap and constantly asked the question: Who is modernization for and can all participate and have equal access to this modernization. </p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-original_image\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/2000_width/public/R%20K%20Laxman%20All%20Pgs_Page_38_Image_0001_0.jpg?itok=JyHrQFYs\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>R.K.
