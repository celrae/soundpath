So what's the better gadget between a blender and juicer if you want to get more beneficial nutrients?","itags":["npr_api","382422706"],"guid":"27d5a699-2a37-462c-8fa7-5a5794aff310","contentencoded":"<p>At a time when Americans consume, on average, only about one serving of fruit and one serving of vegetables a day when we're supposed to consume five to 13 servings, the appeal of juice and smoothies is pretty obvious.</p><p>Juice can be a convenient way to get more servings of fruit and veggies. And, hey, making your own juice concoctions at home can be fun.</p><p>So, here's the question: What's the better gadget, a juicer or a blender? Does one do a better job of boosting the nutrients in the fruit (and veggies)?</p><p>We dug up a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22957912\">study</a> from 2012 in which food scientists at Texas A&M University evaluated both techniques.</p><p>They decided to make grapefruit juice using three different gadgets: a Vitaprep blender, a hand squeezer and a White-Westing electric juicer.</p><p>What they found is the blended juice had significantly higher levels of beneficial phytonutrients compared to the juice made with a juicer (the electric juicer and hand juicer had about the same levels).</p><p>In particular, the blended juice had about a seven-fold higher content of a compound called naringin.</p><p>Naringin is a flavonoid that has been <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174821\">shown</a> to have cancer-fighting properties as well as strong anti-inflammatory and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25022990\">antioxidant activities</a> that may be beneficial for the treatment of diabetes and other metabolic disorder.</p><p>None of this is to say that blending your grapefruit will have a measurable impact on your health.</p><p>But, if you're looking to boost nutrients, this study does show that how you process juice can have a big impact on the levels of flavonoids.</p><p>The authors of the paper tell The Salt they did not expect such a significant difference.</p><p>\"Yes, I was indeed surprised and so was everyone in the lab,\" <a href=\"http://vfic.tamu.edu/rammohan-uckoo-ph-d/\">Rammohan Uckoo</a>, a researcher at the Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center at Texas A&M, tells us by email.</p><p>So, what explains the difference? \"The blended juice had the highest pulp content, which corresponds to the maximum levels of naringin,\" Uckoo says.</p><p>In addition, the blended juice contained more of the fruit's segment membranes — those white layers of papery fiber that line the outside of each segments — which have higher concentrations of flavonoids.</p><p>It's long been known that how we process or cook our foods can influence nutrient levels. For instance, just last week we <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2015/01/22/378920980/for-more-nutrients-drink-oj-or-eat-an-orange-it-s-not-so-clear-cut\">reported</a> on a study that suggested orange juice might unlock more beneficial phytonutrients, compared to an equivalent amount of fruit.</p><p>And when it comes to absorbing nutrients, we're sometimes better off cooking and adding a little fat. As we've <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106968683\">noted</a>, to get the most of fat-soluble carotenoids found in carrots and tomatoes, adding a little olive olive can help our body absorb the beneficial antioxidants.</p><p>The bottom line, according to nutrition researchers, is that a diverse diet that includes a broad range of vegetables and fruits — both juice and whole fruits — is likely the best strategy for health. \"It's really about your dietary pattern,\" says <a href=\"http://hnrca.tufts.edu/people/scientists/a-j/jeffrey-b-blumberg-ph-d/\">Jeffrey Blumberg</a>, a nutrition scientist at the Antioxidant Research Laboratory at Tufts University who has long studied these issues.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
