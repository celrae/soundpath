The biggest bang for the buck comes from improvements that increase curb appeal: a remodeled entryway, new garage door, new siding or exterior paint.

You have to live in it now. “Sometimes -- and this is the unfortunate part,\" he says, \"a seller does everything weeks before they put it on the market, when then they realize that they’ve really never gotten to enjoy it.\"</p>\n<p>When you are ready to sell, though, it’s best not to do renovations out of ‘house-love,’ says Justin Riordan of Spade and Archer Design in Portland. He stages homes for sale.</p>\n<p>“The idea of doing a bathroom the way you would want it to be done? You should never do that,” says Riordan. “Because, of all the people in the world that might buy your house -- you are not one of them.”</p>\n<p>Riordan’s firm will completely furnish and decorate a vacant property, like the $800,000 mid-century colonial where I met him in Irvington, a neighborhood of grand old homes in one of Portland’s most fashionable residential districts.</p>\n<p>In this case, Riordan’s decorating touches included an expensive-looking living room set, paintings, Art Deco glassware, vintage ice skates on the mantelpiece.</p>\n<p>Riordan has made a study of home-buyer behavior -- he’s sort of a pop real-estate psychologist.</p>\n<p>“Buyers are in a condition I call ‘buyer stupid,’” he says. “I was in that state when I bought my house.
