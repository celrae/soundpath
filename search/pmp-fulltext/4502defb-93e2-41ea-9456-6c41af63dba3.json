Steep mountains break up the landscape into hills and hollows, making each little town into its own microcosm in this place some call the “State of the Ozarks”—the state line between Missouri and Arkansas meaning little to them.  Here, families have stayed in the same hollows for generations with little influence from the outside world.  Everyone knows everyone else… and their parents, and their grandparents.  Which means that daily life here is steeped in the past, for better or for worse.
