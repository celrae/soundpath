It's got a harder edge to it than the rootsier music of her past. Then there's that cotton-candy hair and all the glitter; her guitar glitters, her eyes glitter, her shoes glitter. It's easier to talk about what <em>isn't</em> glittered â€” and mostly that'd be her lyrics. In the final song from both her album <em>Make My Head Sing... </em> and this Tiny Desk Concert, \"Seein* Starz,\" she starkly sings:</p><blockquote><p>When it's just us two in the dark</p><p>You've got a stranglehold</p><p>On my heart</p></blockquote><p>When she speaks of her unicorn-adorned guitar knobs, she sounds about 13. But then there are lines like these, from \"Party Drugs\":</p><blockquote><p>Party drugs just make us argue</p><p>Don't know why they didn't used to</p></blockquote><p>In those moments, you're hearing an older, hopefully wiser character. All those schisms in her sound beguile me. On the record, her songs often rock with abandon. Here, they hypnotize.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"Standing In The Sun\"</li><li>\"Party Drugs\"</li><li>\"Seein* Starz\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Colin Marshall</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
