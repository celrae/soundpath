Nearly 3 feet of snow blanketed the Buffalo area, closing major highways and shutting schools.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty bad,&#8221; <strong>Keith Plekan</strong>, owner of K.A.P. Landscaping & Snowplowing in Cheektowaga, told <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now</a></em>. &#8220;It&#8217;s early in November. We&#8217;re getting hit with all the lake effect. Driving bans throughout the whole area county. I&#8217;m actually going out right now. I&#8217;ve got all my troops coming. We&#8217;ve got about four or five trucks. We&#8217;re going to head out now to the most hard hit areas.&#8221;</p><p>And the cold snap extends all the way down to Florida.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just above freezing this morning,&#8221; said <strong>Steve Herbert</strong>, who owns a farm in Walnut Hill, Fla., north of Pensacola. &#8220;It got down to about 28 degrees. This is the coldest we&#8217;ve had it this season and it came just a little early. We needed another week or two to finish selling our sweet corn and butter beans before it froze. We&#8217;ve managed it the last few years and sometimes we have sweetcorn as late as Thanksgiving.&#8221;</p><p>Meanwhile, things are cozy at the South Bend Chocolate Company in South Bend, Indiana, with temperatures in the teens outside. <strong>Mark Tarner</strong> owns the cafe and sweet shop and says the chill is good for business.</p><p>&#8220;You called one of the world’s largest chocolate shops,&#8221; Tarner said. &#8220;We have about 10,000 square foot sprawling winter wonderland I guess. We have an outdoor fire going on right now and we only have about 8 to 12 inches of snow, the roads are clean and everybody is in the café sitting around two alpine fireplaces having great hot chocolate.&#8221;</p><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><strong>Keith Plekan</strong>, owner of <a href=\"http://www.kaplandscaping.com/\" target=\"_blank\">K.A.P.
