It's just like having a roommate, you know, without the chore chart,\" she says.</p><p>When it works, it works well — but not everything is perfect. In O'Brien's space, for example, customers have to do two transactions if they want a coffee from Octane and a croissant from her shop.</p><p>But those hang-ups aren't stopping other businesses from trying out the concept.
