Yat<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">senyuk said on Friday that he now plans to seek the protection of NATO membership.</span></p><p>By Ukrainian law, the country is currently &quot;non-aligned,&quot; but the government is trying to change that. &ldquo;The [Ukrainian] government has said that they&rsquo;re going to submit legislation which would annul Ukraine&rsquo;s non-alliance status,&rdquo; explains the BBC&rsquo;s David Stern.</p><p>Such a move would allow the government in Kiev to formally apply for NATO membership.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Anders Fogh Rasmussen,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">NATO&rsquo;s secretary general,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">said he respects Ukraine&rsquo;s right to seek membership, and he accused Russia of a &ldquo;blatant violation&rdquo; of Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty.</span></p><p>&ldquo;It is now clear that Russian troops and equipment have illegally crossed the border into eastern and southeastern Ukraine,&rdquo; Rasmussen said.</p><p>At the moment, Stern says &ldquo;everyone recognizes that there&rsquo;s not going to be any boots on the ground in Ukraine&rdquo; from NATO. But Kiev is getting &ldquo;non-lethal equipment &mdash; that&rsquo;s night goggles, flak jackets, and meals ready to eat &mdash; from the United States and [other] individual nations.&rdquo;</p><p>But how to take further steps is the real issue &ldquo;The question is, short of actual military intervention or short of actually supplying Ukrainians with serious weapons, what [else] can the West do?&rdquo; Stern says.</p><p>&quot;And the question is really, what can the West do that ultimately causes enough pain further down the road so that Moscow changes its mind?&quot; he adds. &quot;But right now, from all appearances, they&rsquo;re sending at least fighters into Ukraine and possibility even actual troops.&rdquo;</p><p>The United Nations said Friday that the death toll from the conflict in Ukraine now exceeds 2,200 killed.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a war by degrees,&quot; Stern says, &quot;and the Russians have been slowly raising the heat. Each week it seems to get worse and worse.&rdquo;</span></p><p>And regardless of what NATO or the West does, says Stern, things are probably only going to get worse:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&quot;Moscow is going forwards no matter what.&quot;</span></p>","audio":[]}
