The prime minister said he was shocked when he saw this video.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But Ethiopians living in Israel were far from shocked. “They say this is no surprise to them,\" Estrin says. \"They talk about experiencing this kind of discrimination across the board.”</p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_no_border cta_align-left cta_icon-engagement cta_bg-gray\" data-entity-id=\"79917\" data-entity-title=\" FBQA Mengiste\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-79917\" class=\"node node-story-act contextual-links-region story-act-cta story-act-nid-79917 cta-type-custom-text cta-style-none_above clearfix\" about=\"/node/79917\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/79917\">Story Act: FBQA Mengiste</a></h2>\n<div class=\"contextual-links-wrapper\">\n<ul class=\"contextual-links\"><li class=\"node-edit first\"><a href=\"/node/79917/edit?destination=node/79918/edit\">Edit</a></li>\n<li class=\"node-delete last\"><a href=\"/node/79917/delete?destination=node/79918/edit\">Delete</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p><span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Story Act: FBQA Mengiste\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    Discuss  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-teaser\">\n    Maaza Mengiste has written about Ethiopian migration and racism in her fiction and nonfiction.

But Estrin points out a key differencs in the perception of cultural racism between Israel and the United States: \"In the US, race relations have been an ongoing, open wound. Here in Israel, the struggle for Ethiopian Jews has been a much more subdued issue.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Issues of discrimination are not typically discussed in the Israeli media in much detail, Estrin says: “It's part of Israel's larger story. It's a country of immigrants. Each new group of immigrants look down upon the previous group of immigrants. It's the nature of immigrant societies.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But he does hold out some hope that this incident has prompted a larger public conversation about race in Israel. At one protest rally in Jerusalem, Estrin says, an Ethiopian Israeli protester “talked about how they fight for Israel in the army and they feel they give their lives for this country, but that Israel sees our blood is only good for being spilled on the battlefield. There's a real feeling here that after 30 years of Ethiopian Israelis living in this country, young people are rising up and, for the first time, speaking out.”</p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-05-04%2Fethiopian-jews&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/05042015_08.mp3"},{"href":"http://admin.pri.org/file/0504201508mp3"}]}
