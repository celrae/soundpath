In response to the accusation, citizens of Birmingham came together to defend their home. &#8220;In a way,&#8221; Councillor Shah said, &#8220;it’s brought people of Birmingham together. They are very proud to be a British citizen and also very proud to belong to a Muslim religion.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"\">&#8220;Islam promotes peace and tolerance among communities.&#8221;</div></p><p>Birmingham is the most populous British city outside of London with nearly 1.2 million residents.

After the Charlie Hebdo attack in France, the Department for Communities and Local Government in England sent a letter to 1,000 Muslim leaders encouraging them to demonstrate how faith in Islam can be part of English identity.</p><p>&#8220;Certainly Islam doesn&#8217;t promote any kind of violence against anyone,&#8221; said Shah. &#8220;I think these people who are, you know, carrying out these acts of terrorism in the name of Islam, certainly they are not following the religion of Islam because Islam promotes peace and tolerance among communities.”</p><p>In response to people who do believe that Birmingham is a &#8220;no-go&#8221; zone, Shah says, &#8220;I think they should come and visit.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/lordmayor\" target=\"_blank\">Shafique Shah</a></strong>, lord mayor of Birmingham, England.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
