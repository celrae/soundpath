The economy added 74,000 fewer jobs in June and July than originally reported -- pushing the job-creation average during the summer to 148,000 per month.

He says it happens from time to time because the two statistics come from different sources.</p>\n<p>In what’s called the “household survey,” 60,000 American households are asked: How many adults were working last month? How many were looking for work? How many were doing neither? The sampling of households includes young people, old people; married and single; rich and poor from all over the country.

However, compared to the entire employment base, the margin is actually very small. In the household survey, the margin of error is 0.3 percent (399,000 distributed among 144 million total U.S. workers). For the establishment survey, the margin of error is 0.07 percent (92,000 distributed among 136 million total U.S. payroll jobs).</p>\n<p>Economists typically put more weight on the establishment survey than the household survey in any given month: it is derived from several data sources, and is based on a much larger sample size. But over time, the surveys tend to even out and agree. Nardone says both show total job growth of approximately 2 million over the past year.</p>\n<p>And Nardone also points out that the surveys don’t define \"job\" or \"working\" precisely the same. The household survey counts a person as “employed” if they have multiple jobs; in the establishment survey, each job would be counted separately. The household survey includes the self-employed and those working on farms. Nardone says that when these technical differences are accounted for, the surveys converge even more.</p>\n<p>This was the last monthly jobs report before the next meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers. Economists today were quick to speculate on whether the Fed would consider the labor market strong enough to weather a tapering of monetary stimulus beginning in September.</p>\n<p>John Canally, economist at LPL Financial, says Fed policymakers won’t be thrown by the discrepancy in the August jobs report between the household and establishment surveys.</p>\n<p>“The Fed’s going to look not just at today’s jobs report, but at 5 or 10 or 15 other labor-market indicators,” says Canally. These include weekly jobless claims, private payrolls, job openings, layoffs, manufacturing and non-manufacturing payrolls. “If you add it all together, it skews a little closer to what the establishment survey said this month, which is that the economy is adding jobs at a relatively modest pace.”</p></div>","tags":["APM","Economy","Jobs"],"published":"2013-09-06T14:40:24+00:00","itags":["6c28ccb411b7b8ea98f0ca3ecdfa264f","Marketplace","Marketplace for Friday, September 6, 2013","PMP:Marketplace_PMP"],"teaser":"The Labor Department's jobs report comes out every month -- but it's actually two reports in one.
