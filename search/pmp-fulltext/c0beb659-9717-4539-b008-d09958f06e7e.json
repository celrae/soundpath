We don't fish in in marine-protected areas,'\" he says.</p><p>When asked about the ethics of gathering data in the way \"Global Fishing Watch\" does, Manthos argues that this data-gathering is in the public's interest.</p><p>\"When we're talking about the extraction of resources, in many cases from open areas of the ocean and the resources that belong to all of us, the public does need to know,\" he says.</p><p>AIS has been used in conservation projects before. The Global Forest Watch program used AIS data to fight de-forestation. That prompted the private sector to use the data to prove it was following sustainable practices.</p><p>\"It has been an accountability tool,\" Manthos says.</p>","itags":["npr_api","364226948"],"contentencoded":"<p><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 MPX.
