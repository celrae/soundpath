Together the two have turned an obscure student holiday into the country's biggest shopping event.</p><p>In the 1990s, Chinese university students began celebrating being unattached on Nov. 11, which of course is abbreviated 11/11.</p><p>The idea was for singles to go out, go to parties, go to bars without all the Valentine's Day commercial schmaltz.</p><p>At least that's what it was. Now it's the biggest commercial holiday on the planet.</p><p>Chinese shoppers bought more than $9 billion in goods for themselves today. Alibaba began promoting the celebrations in recent years as a way for singles to treat themselves to something special, and online retailers jumped in, offering deep discounts on purchases.</p><p>To put that in perspective, that's almost three times what Americans spent last year on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p><p>Alibaba, which normally ships 16 million packages a day, now has 250 million packages to ship over the next three to five days, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102171362#.\">the company's Chairman Jack Ma told CNBC</a>.</p><p>Ma says he wants the day to be a global holiday. But it could be a tough sell in the United States.</p><p>Alexander Chernev, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, says shopping days are relatively routine for Americans, compared with China's emerging middle class.</p><p>\"This whole shopping experience is fairly new for the average Chinese consumer,\" Chernev says, \"where in the United States it has existed for many decades.\"</p><p>Chernev says the date, Nov. 11, is also too close to Americans' already well-established shopping season and is, of course, already a holiday, Veterans Day, when lots of things go on sale.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
