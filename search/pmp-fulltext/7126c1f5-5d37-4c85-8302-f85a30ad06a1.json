You'll be speaking like a Brit in no time.</p><p>Plus, Serkis explains the origin of Gollum's voice (which he later left on the answering machine of our grand prize winner), and offers a quick tease of his as-yet-unannounced role in J.J. Abrams' upcoming <em>Star Wars</em> film, <em>Episode VII</em>.</p><hr /><h3>Interview Highlights</h3><p><strong>On preparing to play the roles of King Kong and Caesar</strong></p><p>I spent a lot of time researching apes. For King Kong I went to Rwanda and watched gorillas in the wild, and studied apes in zoos. I observed the differences between apes in captivity, which reflect human behavior a lot more in their rhythms, and those in Rwanda, which are like blissed-out hippies, they were incredibly relaxed and wonderful to be around. You take all this research, and then it's all about character. And Caesar is a very complex ape.</p><p><strong>On the origin of Gollum's voice</strong></p><p>He's called Gollum because of the way he sounds, according to Tolkien. So I based it around the notion that he was addicted to the ring, but mostly it was because he was guilty over the murder of his cousin â€“ because of course he kills his cousin to take the ring. He strangles his cousin, so really for him, he carries the memory and the guilt in his throat. But I also wanted something involuntary, like a spasm, that forces Gollum's voice out. So I based it on my cat (Diz, after Dizzy Gillespie) coughing up fur balls.</p><p><strong>On his upcoming role in the new <em>Star Wars</em> film</strong></p><p>I'm not Yoda.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
