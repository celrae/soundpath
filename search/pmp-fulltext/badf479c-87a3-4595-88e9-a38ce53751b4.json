Human rights monitors estimate that some 2,000 villagers died during that attack. Nigeria's government puts the toll in the attacks at Baga and Doron Baga at just 150.</p>\n<p>\"We have taken images only from these two places, but this is a kind of pattern that actually has been repeating in many many different places,\" Crawshaw notes.</p>\n<p>Amnesty calls the January assault \"the largest and deadliest Boko Haram assault\" that it had analyzed.</p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World Â©2014 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/Doro.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/dorojpg"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/011520159.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/011520159mp3"}]}
