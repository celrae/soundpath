In his latest, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt/dp/0393244660/?tag=wburorg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt</a>,&#8221; he details how he thinks Wall Street is rigged by high-frequency traders for their own gain.</p><p>While the new book continues to raise controversy, <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\"><em>Here & Now&#8217;</em></a>s Robin Young asked Lewis where he thought we were in terms of regulating Wall Street six years out from the financial crisis.</p><p>&#8220;The whole subject of government regulation of our financial sector is very frustrating, and it&#8217;s very frustrating because, one, the subject&#8217;s complicated and the system doesn&#8217;t handle complexity very well,&#8221; Lewis said. &#8220;Two, money has a huge effect on our political process, and the financial sector has a lot of money to spend to influence it. Where we are is, you know, there&#8217;s been some attempt in the Dodd-Frank legislation, for example, to address the problems that led to the financial crisis.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"\">&#8220;The technology’s good, but that’s not the point. The point is that Wall Street is capturing still too much of stock brokerage revenues.&#8221;</div></p><p>Lewis says the wiring of the stock market allows high-frequency traders to know when an average investor hits a button to buy a stock, run ahead of that order, buy up the stock before the investor, and sell it back to that average investor for a tiny profit per share.</p><p>All this happens in split seconds, and the flash trader only earns a penny or two a share, but it amounts to billions of dollars a year out of the pockets of smaller, individual investors.</p><p>&#8220;Where we are is in a kind of murky, uncomfortable, unhappy place where the financial sector seems to have had a large say in how it&#8217;s regulated, and, as a result, possibly not regulated enough,&#8221; he added.</p><p>Young asked him about criticism of his book, including people like Joe Nocera, who says it&#8217;s too pat, and others who say that high-frequency trading is actually a positive because it lowers borrowing costs for all traders by by using technology to bypass traditional middleman traders who charged a much higher amount to make the market work.</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t disagree that the technologies offered huge benefits,&#8221; Lewis said. &#8220;That&#8217;s not the point. The point is, the technology&#8217;s also this kind of scalping operation in the middle of the markets, where the markets are, basically, systematically rigged in the favor of a handful of participants who pay for special access, both to the stock exchanges, and to the bank broker&#8217;s customer orders, and have, you know, basically no risk in their training. So what I say is, yeah, the technology&#8217;s good, but that&#8217;s not the point. The point is that Wall Street is capturing still too much of stock brokerage revenues.&#8221;</p><p>In his previous books, Lewis has shown how Wall Street both gamed the system to make money, in part by creating a fog of complexity, and how that complexity in the end fooled many on Wall Street into complacency about the dangers of things like highly leveraged mortgage derivatives.</p><p>In &#8220;Flash Boys,&#8221; Lewis writes of Wall Street: &#8220;What had once been the world&#8217;s most public, most democratic, financial market had become, in spirit, something more like a private viewing of a stolen work of art.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://michaellewiswrites.com/index.html#top\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Lewis</a></strong>, author and financial journalist.
