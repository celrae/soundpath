Finley isn't a bioweapons expert. She's a veterinarian.</p><p>But veterinarians know about <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/\">anthrax</a> because it's caused by a bacteria that lives in soil, and it can infect livestock. So veterinary labs have to be able to test for it.</p><p>Sandia sends vets like Finley to countries around the world to make sure their tests are performed in a secure manner and the anthrax doesn't fall into the wrong hands.</p><p>\"My country happens to be Afghanistan,\" says Finley. She says Afghanistan has a curious problem when it comes to anthrax. The country is a big exporter of animal hides. But these hides can be contaminated with <em>Bacillus anthracis</em>, the anthrax bacteria. Exporters would like to prove their hides aren't.</p><p>\"If they can certify them free of <em>Bacillus anthracis</em> spores, then they can get more money for the hide,\" says Finley.</p><p>For the most reliable test, you have to grow the bacteria. But the U.S. worries that a bunch of labs in Afghanistan growing anthrax won't do much for biological threat reduction.</p><p>\"So we were working with them to try to identify an alternate method,\" Finley says. She went back to New Mexico and told Sandia engineers she needed a test that would require only a tiny sample that would be destroyed when the test was over.</p><p>The engineers at Sandia made a credit-card-size device. A sample first goes into a tiny growth chamber, where bacteria in the sample can divide a few times. Then the sample goes into a test chamber. Fifteen minutes later, you get a color change, whether it's positive or negative, \"similar to what you might see in a pregnancy test.\"</p><p>And then a powerful antiseptic chemical destroys the bacteria. And there's nothing for a terrorist to steal.</p><p>It'll be a few years before the test is ready for prime time. But if it works as advertised, it should make the world a safer place.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
