But in recent years, that task has been complicated by the advent of sneak-attack December releases: At the end of 2013, <em>Beyonce</em> showed up out of nowhere, while in 2014, in one December week alone, listeners could choose from important new releases by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/370926966/dangelo\" target=\"_blank\">D'Angelo</a> (his first album in nearly 15 years), <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/126317980/nicki-minaj\" target=\"_blank\">Nicki Minaj</a> and J. Cole.</p><p>For NPR music writer Stephen Thompson, it's hard to look ahead without acknowledging the reverberations of 2014's final weeks. D'Angelo's sprawling <em>Black Messiah</em>, for example, is sure to loom large over the year that follows its sudden, unanticipated release.</p><p>Arun Rath, host of weekends on <em>All Things Considered</em>, recently asked Thompson to highlight some likely highlights of the next few months, and Thompson offered four: <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15168072/modest-mouse\" target=\"_blank\">Modest Mouse</a>'s <em>Strangers To Ourselves</em> (out March 3), the band's first album in eight years; <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/93941444/laura-marling\" target=\"_blank\">Laura Marling</a>'s bold and aggressive <em>Short Movie</em> (out March 24); a likely breakthrough from the massive-sounding New Jersey rock band <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/94995720/screaming-females\" target=\"_blank\">Screaming Females</a>, called <em>Rose Mountain</em> (out Feb. 24); and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/167456181/the-lone-bellow\" target=\"_blank\">The Lone Bellow</a>'s sleek and soaring <em>Then Came The Morning</em> (out Jan. 27), which makes excellent use of the Van Morrison playbook.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
