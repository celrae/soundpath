When he and Rachel first spoke, Bridges was expecting his company to make layoffs. He told her they did. Although he kept his job, he had to take a pay cut.</p><ul><li><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/09/22/alternate-routes-rohr\" target=\"_blank\">What Issues Matter To Young Americans?</a> (Here & Now&#8217;s first conversation with Rachel)</li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul style=\"color: #000000\"><li><a style=\"color: #2c95c7\" href=\"http://www.wbur.org/about/people/rachel-rohr\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rachel Rohr</strong></a>, social media and web producer for Here & Now, and host of the podcast “Alternate Routes.” She tweets <a style=\"color: #2c95c7\" href=\"https://twitter.com/LionTalk\" target=\"_blank\">@LionTalk.</a></li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
