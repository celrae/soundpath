Martin said, \"<em>The Magicians</em> is to Harry Potter as a shot of Irish whiskey is to a glass of weak tea.\" In his interview with host Ophira Eisenberg on the <em>Ask Me Another</em> stage, Grossman describes the decade he has spent with his magical characters, and why he's ready to move on. His third and last installment of the series, recently published, is <em>The Magician's Land</em>.</p><p>Grossman may be a magic expert, but is he a pinball wizard?

You would no longer have your avuncular adviser â€” there'd be no sort of Dumbledore or Gandalf. Nobody's gonna say, 'Here's this ring. Things are very bad. But here's this ring, there's a volcano over there, take the ring, put it in the volcano, and everything's going to be fine.' There was nobody, there was nobody who would say that ... no direction at all, and you just had to figure out what volcano to put your ring in, and no one would tell you and you never knew afterwards was it the right one. I felt very lost and unadvised, and so it becomes much more a story about people trying to figure out not so much we're gonna use the magic and defeat evil; it becomes much more about trying to figure out what is magic for.</p><p><strong>Why our culture is obsessed with fantasy</strong></p><p>Around the turn of the millennium ... the great pop culture Eye of Sauron turned and looked at magic and became interested. I feel like it's really an expression of disillusionment. I think we went through a phase where we thought technology was the same thing as progress ... and over a long period of time it just meant we got a lot of email from Nigeria and it wasn't enough for us. ... We started looking for answers elsewhere, and I think we turned to magic.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
