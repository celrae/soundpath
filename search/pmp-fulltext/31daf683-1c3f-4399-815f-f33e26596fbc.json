There's an image of a severed hand spurting blood, framed by the word \"LOST\" in block letters and the date: \"9-23-12.\"</p><p>The message underscores Whedbee's frustration with a workers' compensation system in which benefits and access to benefits have changed in North Dakota and across the country.</p><p>\"I lost a hand at work and this is workman's comp,\" Whedbee, 53, says at his home in Pennsylvania. \"Give me what I deserve. I deserve a hand.\"</p><p>Whedbee's orthopedic surgeon said he was a perfect candidate for a high-tech myoelectric arm and hand, which are routinely provided to workplace amputees in other states. The $70,000 device mirrors the look and function of a human limb. But the workers' compensation system in North Dakota instead opted for a mechanical arm with a hook, which costs $50,000 less.</p><p>\"I lost a hand working in North Dakota,\" Whedbee says. \"I didn't lose a hook!\"</p><p>Whedbee's story is the latest piece in an ongoing investigation by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/394891172/insult-to-injury-americas-vanishing-worker-protections\">NPR</a> and <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/series/workers-compensation\">ProPublica</a> that shows how states have slashed workers' compensation benefits in recent years.
