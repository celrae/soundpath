Newspapers and magazines -- LIFE Magazine was a famously important magazine in 1960s -- was more&nbsp;or less destroyed by changes in postal rates.

Postal worker strikes prompted then-President Richard Nixon to pass the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_Reorganization_Act\" target=\"_blank\">Postal Reorganization Act in 1971</a>, which turned the agency into a semi-independent business -- and as a semi-independent business, money started to matter. The Postal Service hasn't used taxpayer money since 1982, with a few exceptions, such as sending absentee ballots to Americans overseas. Today, the USPS relies on the costs of postage and sales for almost all of their expenses.</p>\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"261721\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"First international mail flight, 1919\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"First international mail flight, 1919\",\"field_description[und][0][value]\":\"%3Cem%3E%3Cspan%20style%3D%5C%22line-height%3A%201.538em%3B%5C%22%3EEddie%20Hubbard%20(left)%20and%20William%20E.%20Boeing%20stand%20in%20front%20of%20a%20Boeing%20C-700%20seaplane%20near%20Seattle%2C%20Washington%2C%20after%20returning%20from%20a%20survey%20flight%20to%20Vancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia%2C%20on%20March%203%2C%201919.%20They%20brought%20with%20them%20a%20pouch%20with%2060%20letters%2C%20making%20this%20the%20first%20international%20mail%20flight.%3C%2Fspan%3E%3C%2Fem%3E\",\"field_description[und][0][format]\":\"full_html\",\"field_byline_text[und][0][value]\":\"Boeing Airplane Company/Collection of United States Postal Service\",\"field_migration_notes[und][0][value]\":\"\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"First international mail flight, 1919\",\"title\":\"First international mail flight, 1919\",\"height\":429,\"width\":600,\"style\":\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857em;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]</p>\n<p>Some say the Postal Service stopped innovating because its business model changed, and the funds simply weren't there.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, we'll talk with someone who thinks the story isn't so simple.&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><span><a name=\"Thursday\" id=\"Thursday\"></a><strong>Thursday</strong>: Why the USPS doesn't do email</span></p>\n<p>Why isn’t there an @usps.gov email address available to the public -- one that carries with it the same privacy laws that apply to postal mail?</p>\n<p><span>Shiva Ayyadurai asked USPS management that same question in 1997, the year he calls \"The Crossover,\" when email volume exceeded postal mail volume.</span> <span>At the time, Ayyadurai says the USPS did not see email as a threat to first-class mail.
