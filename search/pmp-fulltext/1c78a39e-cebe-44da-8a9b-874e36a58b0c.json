In advance of it, a draft document states flatly: \"there is no discussion here of women priests, which according to statistics is not something that women want.\"</p><p>One of the draft topics that has drawn the most attention concerns plastic surgery, which the document says \"can amputate the expressive possibilities of the human face and can be aggressive toward the feminine identity.\"</p><p>One woman quoted in the report said, \"plastic surgery is like a burqa made of flesh.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
