He had what he calls a midlife crisis, and left his wife and three kids in Massachusetts to live on his own in Chicago.</p><p>But after two years apart, Frank came back. The entire family moved to Chicago, and Frank brought his oldest son, Jack, to StoryCorps because he wanted to apologize.</p><p>\"Do you remember that time?\" Frank asks Jack.</p><p>\"Yeah, I was like the dad in the house,\" says Jack, now 13. \"I took care of [younger brothers] Dave and Ben sometimes. And it was one of the hardest times in my life because I was without my best friend.\"</p><p>\"I knew I was hurting you, but I felt like I had to get myself straightened out first before I could be your dad again,\" Frank says. \"And I also want to tell you that I'm sorry that I caused you that pain when I left. That was a tough time.</p><p>\"But probably the proudest moment we ever had together was when I came back to watch you play that really important baseball game\" — the last game of the season, Frank continues.</p><p>\"You must have gotten three hits, and I remember thinking, 'We did that together.' You know, we practiced, and that's why you did so well,\" Frank recalls. \"It made me realize I was ready to make sure that I was going to be as good a father as I could possibly be. And that was the impetus that got us back together.\"</p><p>\"I felt like I was in paradise again because, like, I just feel I relate to you so much — and, like, I regained part of my life,\" Jack says.</p><p>\"I wanted to tell you, my father used to say to me I was his closest buddy. We did everything together, and he said I stopped being his buddy when I turned 13,\" Frank says. \"And you turn 13 in 3 1/2 months, and so I want you to tell me you're gonna keep being my buddy past 13.\"</p><p>\"I'm gonna be your best friend until I die,\" Jack responds. \"If I didn't have you, I'd be broken. How does it feel when, like, when you know that you come home to such a great family?\"</p><p>\"It feels great,\" Frank says. \"You know, when I was a boy dreaming about what it would be like to have a wife and a house, I was gonna name my oldest son Frank, because that would have been the fourth Frank. But, I didn't name you after me because I knew you were gonna be better. And the way you deal with people with your heart is — is something that I've learned a lot from.</p><p>\"So Jack, I just want to tell you how proud of you that I am. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. And we'll always find a way to come back together.\"</p><p>\"Yeah,\" Jack says. \"We'll get through it as a family.\"</p><p><em>Produced for </em>Morning Edition<em> by Jasmyn Belcher.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
