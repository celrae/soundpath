She's a provocateur. She's Asian.Â But Awkwafina, a Queens-born rapper, says none of that should be out of place, either in the hip-hop world or the United States.","contentencoded":"<p>Awkwafina&rsquo;s breakout hit was a song that riffed on a popular hip-hop track. The original celebrated a male MC&rsquo;s personal &quot;endowment.&quot; &nbsp;Awkwafina&rsquo;s version celebrated ... well, hers. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The song starts:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>My vag, like an operatic ballad.</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Your vag, like grandpa&rsquo;s cabbage.</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>And my vag, effortless.</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Your vag post ads on Craigslist.</em></p><p>The song, appropriately titled &quot;My Vag,&quot; went viral. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The rapping could never exist without the element of comedy,&quot; says Awkwafina &mdash; aka Nora Lum.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&ldquo;Comedy has been a part of me since I was very young, which is why my conservative Korean and Chinese family weren&rsquo;t surprised. They were like, &#39;If you were going to be doing anything, it would obviously be pulling a cat out of my a--.&#39;&rdquo;</span></p><p>You&rsquo;ll just have to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z726OPwCnjE\">watch the music video</a> for that part.</p><p>Ironically, for all of the attention her lyrics get,&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Awkwafina says she channels most of her musical energy into making and mixing her own beats, which she calls her &quot;real passion.&quot; Writing rhymes is almost an afterthought in the creative process.</span></p><p>But it&#39;s thos<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">e smart and sometimes crass rhymes that</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&nbsp;endear Awkwafina to her fans. Her audience, which&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">includes many atypical hip-hop listeners, loves</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&nbsp;her blunt attitude, comedic edge and willingness to take on just about any topic.&nbsp;</span></p><p>One of her most popular songs has become an almost modern-day anthem for New York City. In it, she calls out the rich kids who&rsquo;ve taken over the city and turned it into a caricature of itself:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>New York City b****,&nbsp;</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>that&rsquo;s where I come from.</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>Not where I moved to</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>on Mom and Daddy&rsquo;s Trust Fund.</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>New York City B****.</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m rolling.</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>You out-of-state fakes</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>get your iPads stolen.</em></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">The 26-year-old, who grew up in Queens, says she&rsquo;s always felt like a bit of a misfit. That&#39;s especially true in the world of hip-hop and entertainment. She&#39;s had a lot of labels attached to her</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&nbsp;&mdash; comedian, hipster, feminist, rapper &mdash; but the one that usually gets the most attention is simply &quot;Asian&quot; &mdash; even though her music barely touches on her ethnic heritage.</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">In some ways, Awkwafina understands why the label attracts such attention.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&quot;We haven&rsquo;t reached that level where it&#39;s just a normal thing where we can turn on the TV and see an Asian person ... that&#39;s not there for marketing or diversity reasons,&quot; she says. &quot;There is still a degree of shock when people see me in a music video or me talking.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p><div>But in reality, Awkwafina says, &ldquo;I am just one of the many anomalies that come with growing up in New York City and being born here to essentially immigrant parents, you know what I mean?&rdquo; She<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&nbsp;was mostly raised by her Chinese grandmother and father, who came to New York when he was young.</span></div><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">When I meet Awkwafina, she&rsquo;s decked out in what, at first glance, seems like typical hip-hop bling. But the gold rings on her fingers are a bit unusual. One of them has the word &quot;Pho&quot; &mdash; the Vietnamese noodle soup &mdash; on it. &nbsp;And that, she points out, is just the tip of the iceberg. She owns rings that say &quot;nachos,&quot; &quot;sandwiches,&quot; and even &quot;despair.&quot;</span></p><p>Those iconoclastic tendencies haven&rsquo;t always endeared her to the mainstream hip-hop and music worlds, but&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Awkwafina points out that hip-hop is a constantly evolving art form:&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a part of a very large wave that is changing hip-hop right now,&rdquo; she says.</span></p><p><em><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">The following video is not suitable for all audiences.</span></em></p>","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/0917201410.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0917201410mp3"},{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-taYShNaPU"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/awkwafina-nyc-bitche-official-video"}]}
