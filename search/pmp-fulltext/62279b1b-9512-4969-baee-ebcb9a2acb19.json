Nine bodies are believed to remain inside the ship.</p><p>\"Most of the victims were actually students from a single high school,\" NPR's Elise Hu reports, \"so this obviously sent the country into deep grief — but also outrage, since the rescue effort was widely viewed as bungled.\"</p><p>The ship's captain and several crew members notoriously abandoned the ship as it was sinking. The ship tilted at an extreme angle, and it's been reported that conflicting orders were given to passengers. A <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/04/20/305338621/ferry-transcript-shows-confusion-and-panic-please-come-quickly\">transcript of radio distress calls</a> showed confusion and panic.</p><p>More than half of the ship's crew members survived; several were arrested. The captain <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/11/11/363232471/south-korean-ferry-captain-sentenced-to-36-years\">was later sentenced</a> to more than 30 years in jail. The ferry's owners have also faced intense scrutiny, and one month after the disaster, Park <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/05/19/313859014/south-koreas-president-will-disband-its-coast-guard\">disbanded the Coast Guard</a>.</p><p>The president's promise today \"is the first time that Park explicitly mentioned the salvage,\" the <a href=\"http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2015/04/16/0200000000AEN20150416001455315.html\">Yonhap news agency</a> says.</p><p>The pledge comes as relatives of the victims demand accountability and closure. They're also unhappy with the government's plan to place a special inquiry into the tragedy under the control of the president's office.</p><p>Thursday, families at one memorial altar turned their backs on the country's prime minister. And <a href=\"http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150416001131\">The Korea Herald</a> reports, \"families of the missing, who have camped in makeshift homes at Jindo Harbor since the accident, vacated the spot upon hearing of the president's planned visit, in an apparent show of protest.\"</p><p>Other politicians' attempts to visit memorial sites were met with boos — and in one case, a brawl, the newspaper reports.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
