It's called <em>In Paradise,</em> and it caps a career spanning six decades and 33 books.</p><p>Matthiessen is the only writer to ever win a National Book Award in both fiction — for his last book, <em>Shadow Country,</em> and adult nonfiction for his 1978 travel journal, <em>The Snow Leopard</em>.</p><p>Matthiessen is filled with the vitality of past adventures as he leads a tour of his country-style home on the East End of Long Island. I visited him in March, on the day before he was to begin a round of experimental chemotherapy for cancer.</p><p>On the living room wall are a dozen large black-and-white photographs of New Guinea tribal warriors. The pictures were taken in 1961 — half by the author, the others by his traveling companion, Michael Rockefeller, who disappeared on that expedition, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/03/18/291140637/cannibals-and-colonialism-solving-the-mystery-of-michael-rockefeller\">may have been the victim of cannibals</a>. Matthiessen wrote a book about that journey called <em>Under the Mountain Wall</em> — one of his many nonfiction chronicles of man and his relation to the natural world.</p><p>His new novel, <em>In Paradise</em>, is based on a different kind of journey — a trek into the Heart of Darkness. In 1996, Matthiessen, who is a Zen Buddhist, traveled to Poland on a meditation retreat. It took place at the former Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz. What he saw floored him — he recalls the barbed wire, the watch towers, and the crematoriums.</p><p>\"The gas chambers were all blown up at the end of the war, so they are simply these grim-looking pale ruins out in the distance,\" he says. \"It's a very grim scene. And so it's the enormity of it that just stuns you the first time.\"</p><p>Matthiessen tried to capture that experience in a book of journals, but he says the writing was flat. So he cast the story as a novel. The hero of <em>In Paradise</em> was born in Poland to a Jewish mother, but taken to America as an infant and baptized. Now, with a faded photo in his pocket, he is returning — 50 years later — to search for his mother in the place where she may have perished:</p><p><blockquote></p><p>In this empty place then, at the end of autumn, 1996, what was left to be illuminated? What could the witness of warm, well-fed visitors possibly signify? How could such \"witness\" matter, and to whom? No one was listening.</p><p></blockquote></p><p>McKay Jenkins is editor of <em>The Peter Matthiessen Reader</em> and has also done research at a concentration camp in Austria. \"The way he articulates the rage, the despair, the existential delirium when you're in a place like this was precisely what I felt,\" Jenkins says.\"... What he does in this book is that he captures the incredible brokenness that one experiences at this place,\" Jenkins says. \"[Matthiessen's phrase ] 'broken-brained and wholly broken-hearted' is precisely the way one feels.\"</p><p>With <em>In Paradise, </em>Matthiessen's career has come full circle — from writing about the extinction of animals in his early nonfiction, to writing about the extinction of man. \"Man has been a murderer forever,\" he writes.</p><p>\"The number of people killed in the past century — human beings killing each other is phenomenal, you know?\" Matthiessen says. \"How has civilization — so called — come this far and people are still designing tools to kill each other? For no other purpose than killing. Why are we doing it? Why are we doing it?\"</p><p>Matthiessen says he wants the readers of <em>In Paradise </em>to consider the potential for evil in all of us.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
