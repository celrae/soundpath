School authorities, citing concern over France's secularity law, asked her to leave and come back with a more neutral outfit.</p>\n<p>The student, known only as Sarah K, is at the center of a controversy in France over its 2004 secular law banning overt religious symbols, including Muslim niqabs, large Christian crosses and Jewish skullcaps. Sarah wore none of these to school. Rather, her choice of a long black skirt inspired the principal of her school in the village of Charleville-Mézières, north of Paris, to send her home with a note to her parents, telling them to \"rectify her clothes if you want her to continue her schooling.\"</p>\n<p>This Tweet, widely circulated, showed a  photo of a school-aged girl who could well be Sarah K.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Sarah K.'s super cute maxi-skirt isn't the problem.
