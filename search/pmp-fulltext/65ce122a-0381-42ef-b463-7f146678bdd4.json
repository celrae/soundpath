For example, I seem to have developed a habit of unintentionally groping people. If I knock into someone I don&#8217;t notice it so much. A little awkward, peculiar.  I&#8217;ve become a serial groper, an unwitting serial groper.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On what has surprised him the most</strong></p><p>&#8220;The [donor&#8217;s family] said, &#8216;Our son gave the best hugs. We pray that you make a wonderful recovery and that your loved ones will be able to enjoy your warm embrace&#8217;&#8230; I had thought I had missed being able to give hugs and to embrace, but what I hadn&#8217;t realized was how much that actually meant. You have a memory of it, but then when you can do it &#8212; I can&#8217;t give enough hugs now!&#8221;</p><p><strong>On public reaction to his transplant</strong></p><p>&#8220;People have been asking how I feel about organ donation; gee, I don&#8217;t want to put it so coarsely but essentially the thought is, you know, &#8216;what do you feel like having a dead person&#8217;s arms on your arms?&#8217; And that&#8217;s not how I look at it at all. These arms are completely alive and are my own.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnrmYoWqMLM\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://thegratefulwill.blogspot.com/p/about-will_23.html\" target=\"_blank\">Will Lautzenheiser</a></strong>, filmmaker, teacher of screenwriting and film production, and quadruple amputee.</li><li><strong>Tom Lautzenheiser</strong>, regional scientist for the Massachusetts Audubon Society and Will’s twin brother.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
