His militia once fought American soldiers and is now mobilizing to take on ISIS, but Sadr and others, even some Iraqi politicians, want no part of US-led airstrikes against the terrorist group.","contentencoded":"<p>Moqtada al-Sadr is back. The<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&nbsp;radical Shiite cleric, who organized a militia to fight Americans during the war in Iraq, is now</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&nbsp;rallying his troops against ISIS. And &mdash; surprise &mdash; he says he doesn&#39;t need American help with that.</span></p><p>The US now heads a coalition that&#39;s bombing ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, but Sadr has denounced the American-led intervention. He addressed the United States directly in a press statement, saying, &ldquo;we gave you a taste of the heat of our fire and our might in the past. We will give a taste of the scourge of this decision, which will be the cause of your regrets and regression.&quot;</p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">BBC correspondent </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Lyse Doucet</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">, who&#39;s on assignment in Baghdad, says Sadr&#39;s new &quot;Peace Brigade&quot; is all over the streets of the Iraqi capital. &ldquo;They were talking to the soldiers and to the police on the street, although they operate quite independently,&quot; she says. &quot;They were very clear with us [saying] &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t need the West to come back, we don&rsquo;t need America and we don&rsquo;t need Britain.&#39;&rdquo;</span></p><p>And Sadr is not the only religious leader organizing militias to fight ISIS.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met another prominent cleric, Sheikh Alloush, who heads the Abbas Brigade, which fights not just in Iraq but also in Syria,&quot; Doucet says. &quot;Both of these clerics launched recruitment drives. And in Sheikh Alloush&rsquo;s case ... he&rsquo;s recruiting Shias, which is a good development in a place where the sectarian split is one of the most dangerous fault lines.&rdquo;</span></p><p>The clerics are united in their distrust of the US and other Western countries intervening in Iraq.</p><p>&ldquo;They feel that when these countries come back to Iraq, they come with their own agenda,&rdquo; Doucet says. &ldquo;But I have to say, it&rsquo;s not just these more radical Shiite groups who are saying that. I&rsquo;ve spoken to members of [Iraqi] Parliament; I&rsquo;ve spoken to senior government officials who talk about the double standard of the west. One of the deputy governors said to me &lsquo;Why did America wait so long to come? It was only when they saw the minorities, the Yazidis and the Kurds were in dire straits.&#39;&quot;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>&quot;don&#39;t need American dog to fight Daesh cat&quot; Strong words <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Iraq?src=hash\">#Iraq</a> Abbas Brigade.
