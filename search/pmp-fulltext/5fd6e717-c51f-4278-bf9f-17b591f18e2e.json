February 2003.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>That’s the task that Richard Johnson takes on. The experienced graphic artist has traveled several times to Afghanistan and Iraq, where he hand-sketched images of the wars. His latest series for the Washington Post is titled \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/world/drawing-the-drawdown/\">Drawing up the Drawdown.</a>\"</p>\n<p>Johnson returned to Maryland this week from his latest trip to Afghanistan, and he readily acknowledges the difficulties of his work.</p>\n<p>“I have no clue what I’m doing,” he admits. “There is no doubt that when I’m out there — as well-intentioned as I may be — when we’re on patrol, my life is in the hands of those guys. And to a degree you can certainly understand why it takes me a while to gain [the soldiers’] trust, because I am a risk to them.”</p>\n<p>He pushed himself to sketch nonstop during this latest trip. “Basically, I didn’t stop drawing for the six weeks I was there,” he says. That included sketching at times when he previously would have stopped.</p>\n<p>“Places where I think I would’ve tucked my sketchpad out of the way — like flying with the doors open on a Blackhawk helicopter — I’ve kept my sketchpad in my hand and continued drawing through a lot of those scenarios,” he says.</p>\n<p>That resulted in more candid images of the soldiers — and more honest encounters.</p>\n<p>“For me, it’s all about these accidental interactions,\" he says. \"If I can help it, it’s never staged. It’s always completely natural. Either I start drawing, and they ask me what the hell I’m doing, or I talk to them and ask them if I can draw them. Or, at times, I’ll just draw them anyways, and once they’re drawn, I’ll offer them up a sketch depending on what they’re doing.”</p>\n<p>While he says his craft isn’t any better or worse than that of a photographer, he does admit that there are intrinsic differences between the two art forms — both in practice and effect.</p>\n<p>“The image you’re seeing when you process something I’ve sketched is a much more human image than the camera ever gives you,” he explains. “For people looking at it, there’s a feeling of much more contact there.” He thinks that can be useful for many of the stories that seem to be overloading audiences this year.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"622\" width=\"796\" style=\"font-size: 12.7272720336914px; line-height: 20.0063037872314px;\" alt=\"Marine Corporal Robert Martin stands in a force protection trench somewhere in the Iraqi desert.
