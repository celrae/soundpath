They were talking about continuing to build settlements, maybe withdrawing form some. There was really very little difference on the position to ward the Palestinians between the two major parties.&#8221;</p><p>Khouri says the shift toward conservatism in Israeli politics and society is a source of concern for the rest of the region.</p><p>&#8220;The fear in the Arab world is that we are now seeing the reality, which is a very militant, right-wing, super-nationalist Israeli populist majority that leads Israel democratically,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And this is a huge challenge to the international community who have assumed there will be a negotiation leading to two states, and Netanyahu is saying not in my time.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.aub.edu.lb/units/tcrg/about/members/Pages/RamiKhoury.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Rami Khouri</a></strong>, senior public policy fellow at the American University of Beirut and editor-at-large for Lebanon&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Rami-G-Khouri.ashx#axzz37Advmr1X\" target=\"_blank\">The Daily Star</a>.
