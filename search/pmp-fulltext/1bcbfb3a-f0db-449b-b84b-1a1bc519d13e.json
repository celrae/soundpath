But for Nampa, Idaho, resident <strong>Kenton Lee</strong>, the shoes are the answer to a question he first asked eight years ago after spending time in an orphanage in Kenya.</p><p>There, he noticed that children were cutting holes in their shoes to accommodate growing feet, if they had shoes at all.</p><p>&#8220;That was a lightbulb day for me,&#8221; he told <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I hadn&#8217;t seen it before. I just noticed this little girl next to me in a white dress. She had to cut open the front of her shoes to let her toes stick out. I looked around and so many of the kids has shoes on that were just way too small.&#8221;</p><p>What they needed, he realized, was a shoe that could expand somehow, as their feet grew.</p><p>Now, &#8220;<a href=\"https://theshoethatgrows.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Shoe That Grows</a>&#8221; is ready and getting rave reviews from its testers in Kenya.</p><p>But Lee, who founded the nonprofit organization Because International, says the journey from idea to product was not simple, since had no previous experience in product design or marketing.</p><p>&#8220;We tried to give the idea away,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We just wanted someone to do this. We didn&#8217;t really care who did it.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/107434916\">https://vimeo.com/107434916</a></p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"https://theshoethatgrows.org/our-story.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Kenton Lee</strong></a>, founder of <a href=\"http://becauseinternational.org/\">Because International</a> and inventor of The Shoe That Grows.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
