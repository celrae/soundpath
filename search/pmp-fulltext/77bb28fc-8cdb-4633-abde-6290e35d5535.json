Asylum seekers might receive a hearing, but no attorney is provided to them. For that reason, advocacy organizations are scrambling to arrange pro bono representation for many of the recently arrived immigrants.</p><p><strong>What is Temporary Protective Status?</strong></p><p>The Immigration Act of 1990 authorized status known as Temporary Protective Status. TPS can be offered to foreign nationals already in the U.S. who are unable to safely return to their home country because of natural disaster, armed conflict or some other extraordinary situation.</p><p>It's one alternative legal route that \"might be available to the unaccompanied children,\" according to Garcia.</p><p>TPS isn't ideal: It doesn't provide an avenue to normalize one's status, nor does it offer the rights and privileges that citizenship offers. Still, if someone is desperate and in need of safe haven, TPS could provide a valuable temporary fix.</p><p>It would be within the power of the administration, working with the State Department, to offer some unaccompanied minors TPS as a legal way to remain and work in the U.S., Garcia said. The status would presumably expire as soon as the State Department determines that conditions in their home countries have sufficiently improved.</p><p><strong>So, does Congress really need to act?</strong></p><p>Not according to Garcia. \"So many people are talking about immigration reform and the need for Congress to come back and finally pass some omnibus immigration reform package,\" she told Inskeep. \"But there are resources within the existing law that the administration could explore if it chose to do so to accommodate these children.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
