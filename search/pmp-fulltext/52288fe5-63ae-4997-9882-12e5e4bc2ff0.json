Linkevicius says the adoption of the Euro was just &#8220;a formality.&#8221;</p><p>Lithuania wanted to adopt the Euro in 2007 &#8212; but the country&#8217;s economy was severely crippled by the financial crisis, and it was unable to meet the terms necessary to join the European currency.</p><p>Lithuania implemented a series of austerity measures including severe cuts in public salaries and pensions to prop up the economy.</p><p>Linkevicius says the hardest part for Lithuanians in adopting the new currency is &#8220;psychological.&#8221; The litas was adopted after Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union.</p><p>&#8220;We are proud of our national currency,&#8221; Linkevicius said. &#8220;But pragmatically speaking &#8230; We need to fix it, to make less obstacles for business, also for customers, for people. And they will realize that.&#8221;</p><p>Linkevicius says adopting the Euro is not just a financial issue but a &#8220;geopolitical project.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Being part of this monetary union is one more logical step to complete European integration and implicitly &#8212; in security terms &#8212; it looks like a security guarantee for us,&#8221; Linkevicius said referring to Russia. &#8220;We can provoke them by being weak, by being inconsistent. By being united, we&#8217;ll be stronger.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.urm.lt/default/en/officials/ministras\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Linas Linkevicius</strong></a>, Lithuania&#8217;s minister of foreign affairs.
