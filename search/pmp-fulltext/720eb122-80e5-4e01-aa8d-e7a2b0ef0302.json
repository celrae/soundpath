CLW also found &#8220;inhumane&#8221; working conditions at companies supplying to Samsung.</p><p>Samsung vowed to improve conditions for workers at its suppliers, promising to eliminate practices like illegal overtime, and said that it had &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; for child labor.</p><p>But today&#8217;s report of child labor comes just a week after an Samsung review found no child labor at its suppliers. China Labor Watch says it proves Samsung &#8220;has put its energy into audits and the production of these reports, but these things are meant to appease investors and don&#8217;t have any real value for workers. Samsung&#8217;s monitoring system is ineffective and has failed to bring about improvements for workers.&#8221;</p><p>Samsung says it is &#8220;urgently looking into the latest allegations and will take appropriate measures in accordance with our policies to prevent any cases of child labor in our suppliers.&#8221;</p><p><em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Meghna Chakrabarti speaks with Bloomberg Radio correspondent <strong>Bob Moon</strong> about the potential business consequences for Samsung of these allegations.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Bob Moon</strong>, reporter for Bloomberg Radio.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
