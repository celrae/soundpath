Each has at least one tale behind it, and <em>All Things Considered</em><em> </em>host Melissa Block has been telling some of them as part of the series <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/297284277/deep-in-the-heart-of-a-transforming-texas\" target=\"_blank\">Deep In the Heart Of (A Transforming) Texas</a>.</p><p>One of them is <a href=\"http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hrw44\" target=\"_blank\">Weeping Mary</a>, an unincorporated town in rural east Texas. It was established as a \"freedom colony\" with land given to former slaves after the Civil War.</p><p>Photographer O. Rufus Lovett started photographing the residents of Weeping Mary in 1994. There are a <a href=\"http://www.texasmonthly.com/content/there%E2%80%99s-something-about-weeping-mary\" target=\"_blank\">few stories</a> as to how the town got its name, but one tends to stick.</p><p>\"There was a lady named Mary who lived there and folklore has it, anyway, that a white man wanted to purchase her land. And she did not want to sell it to a white man,\" Lovett says.</p><p>The man in question persuaded a black man to purchase the land for him instead.</p><p>\"So Mary was tricked out of selling her land to another African-American,\" he says. \"She became very distraught over this and wept and wept.\"</p><p>She became known as \"Weeping Mary,\" and the community later adopted the name.</p><p>When Lovett first started taking photos in the town, getting anyone to share the origin story was tough.</p><p>\"[I] had to do a little coaxing after visiting Weeping Mary over a period of time to even get the story from elders in the community,\" he says. \"So this is front-porch lore in Weeping Mary.\"</p><p>And for now, that lore seems to stay with older folks in the town.</p><p>\"I'm not sure how much that's passed down anymore,\" he says. \"And oftentimes they don't want to discuss that because of the circumstances because it did deal with a racial issue. At the same time, it's part of our history, unfortunately. In a way, it's part of who we are.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
