Some make it. Many others do not. But win or lose, when they go home, they leave behind more than just their footprints.</p><p>The chief of Nepal&#8217;s mountaineering association recently announced that the levels of human waste left by climbers have reached a critical level, and the pollution is threatening to spread disease.</p><p>But Mount Everest is not the first to face that problem. Ask North America&#8217;s tallest peak, Mount McKinley &#8212; also known as Denali &#8212; in Alaska.</p><p>As recently as 2000, rangers at Denali feared the mountain would have to close to the public due to an overwhelming amount of waste.</p><p>&#8220;Fifty years ago, it was huge,&#8221; veteran mountaineer <strong>Roger Robinson </strong>tells <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson.</p><p>&#8220;I got involved, 40 years ago on a clean up climb, and started to experience the drama of Denali being a very dirty mountain both with garbage and human waste and everything you could imagine,&#8221; Robinson said. &#8220;Back in those years, you could just pretty much poke an ice ax in the snow and come up with garbage.&#8221;</p><p>It was easy to teach people to keep the garbage under control Robinson remembered, but human waste proved a challenge.</p><p>&#8220;People were often sick at the camps from acquiring bad snow to melt for water, it was a concern all the time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that was one of our biggest issues was having to go out and direct climbers to get snow away from the camps to melt for water.&#8221;</p><p>In response, the national park designed the Clean Mountain Can, known as a CMC to climbers. These cylindrical containers measure 11 inches tall with an 8 inch diameter opening, and weigh 2.4 pounds. They are also specifically engineered to carry human waste at high elevations.</p><p>The CMC&#8217;s, Robinson says, are lined with biodegradable bags, which people will then dispose of through &#8220;crevassing.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;These are large cracks in the glacier, 300 to 400 feet deep, and it takes fifty to several hundred or thousand years before it resurfaces,&#8221; Robinson said.</p><p>But will a solution like this work on Everest?</p><p>&#8220;It should,&#8221; Robinson said. &#8220;It really comes down to their government seeing this is a possibility.&#8221;</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/dena/learn/nature/upload/TrackingHumanWaste2012.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Read more about tracking crevassed human waste on Denali</a></li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Roger Robinson</strong>, 35-year veteran mountaineering ranger for Denali National Park.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
