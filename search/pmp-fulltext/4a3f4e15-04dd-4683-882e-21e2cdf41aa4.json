On the soundtrack for Baz Luhrmann's <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, he even recast his old hits as jazz tunes.</p><p>Now, Ferry returns to the brooding style he pioneered with <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/95667902/roxy-music\" target=\"_blank\">Roxy Music</a> in the 1970s and early '80s. It's probably not an accident that the title, <em>Avonmore</em>, echoes that of the 1982 Roxy Music album <em>Avalon:</em> The new work is cut from the same swanky cloth.</p><p>Ferry's new songs conjure distinct atmospheres. At different times, you might feel heat coming off pavement, shadows moving across blank walls.</p><p>The songs address the euphoria of love — or its sad aftermath. The words can seem routine. The art is in the delivery: Ferry uses a shorthand of whispers and smoldering asides to tell stories. He's often slightly hurt, waiting warily for the next knife-twist of a romance. The same character turns up in an eerie, trance-like rendition of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15871266/stephen-sondheim\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Sondheim</a>'s \"Send In The Clowns.\"</p><p><em>Avonmore</em> isn't uniformly captivating. On a few songs, it relies on repetition a little too much. But this is classic Bryan Ferry, and his sultry, hypnotic allure sustains from start to finish.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
