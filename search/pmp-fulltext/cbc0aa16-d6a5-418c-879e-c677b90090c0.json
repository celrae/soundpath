But on that day, he had switched shifts with another kitchen worker, Moises Rivas.</p><p>\"I was a prep cook, so for eight hours peeling potatoes and cleaning onions. And when Moises Rivas was hired, I was assigned to train him. We had a strong relationship because I was directing his work,\" says Siby, in a remembrance recorded for StoryCorps and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.</p><p>Three days before Sept. 11, Rivas asked Siby to swap shifts. \"Do you mind working for me on Sunday, and I'll pick up your shift on Tuesday?\" he asked.</p><p>On Tuesday, the planes hit the towers. \"He did not make it,\" Siby says. \"He has two kids.\"</p><p>More than 70 of Siby's other colleagues also died that day, many of them also immigrants. <br /> <br /> \"Losing one person in your life is traumatic, but I lost a lot of people. And what I compare it to is the experience of a soldier, without being a soldier,\" he says. \"Because a soldier is trained to lose [a] massive amount of people. And we were just kitchen workers.\"<br /> <br /> After Sept. 11, Siby, now 49, drove a cab for more than a year. He liked that the job was impersonal. \"You know, take this person [from] point A and I drop you [at] point B. Let's not make friends. Because I felt like if I had to lose another close friend of mine, I don't think I would be able to recoup from it,\" he says. <br /> <br /> \"The feeling of why Moises, why not me, is something that will travel in me my entire life. He went to work and never made it home.\"</p><p><em>Audio produced for </em>Morning Edition<em> by Jud Esty-Kendall.</em></p><p><em>StoryCorps is a national nonprofit that gives people the chance to interview friends and loved ones about their lives.
