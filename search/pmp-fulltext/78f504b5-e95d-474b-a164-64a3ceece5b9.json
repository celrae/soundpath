But the friends of slain husband-and-wife Muslim students cannot muster much enthusiasm for the outgoing of support in their memory.</p>\n<p>Before he was killed on Tuesday, Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, had hoped to raise $20,000 to provide dental supplies to Syrian refugees. This summer, his plan was to travel to refugee camps in Turkey with some of his University of North Carolina-School of Dentistry classmates.</p>\n<p>By early Friday, more than 6,000 people contributed more than $330,000 to Barakat's donation <a href=\"http://www.youcaring.com/medical-fundraiser/syrian-dental-relief/206249\">page</a>. This windfall of donations means that the <a href=\"https://www.sams-usa.net/foundation/\">Syrian American Medical Society</a>, which was collaborating with Barakat on the mission to Turkey, will be able to open two more dental clinics at Syrian refugee camps and fund other medical missions- all in the name of Barakat and his wife, who was recently accpted to <a href=\"https://www.dentistry.unc.edu/news/2015/2015-02-11_barakat.cfm\">UNC's dental program</a>.</p>\n<p>“It’s been said that there could be a silver lining,\" said Dr. Ala Dean Attar, a Chicago-area dentist. Last summer, Barakat had asked Attar, a member of the Syrian American Medical Society, to lead the trip to Turkey. \"The tremendous outpouring of support — and you think, 'Wow, $300,000 or half a million is going to go a long way for the refugees.' That was [Barakat's] legacy, that’s what he wanted, but you could never replace such a loss of human life.\"</p>\n<p>Barakat was conntected to Attar, through a mutual friend. Attar had made medical mission trips to Syrian refugee camps and to Syria before, and agreed to help Barakat.</p>\n<p>\"He asked me to head the mission and really be a big part of it. Since then, we've been talking about it once a week. My whole relationship with Deah was really on the phone, but I feel like I know him like a brother,\" Attar says. \"He was someone who was doing such good work. He was a hero, really. We were really looking forward to meeting each other.\"</p>\n<p>\"He's Syrian American. I'm Syrian American. His parents are first-generation Syrian and mine are too. He was very passionate and very commited to doing something about the situation in Syria.\"</p>\n<p>Attar says that despite Barakat's unexpected death, he and the group of UNC dental students still plan to go to Turkey in July.</p>\n<p>\"But the whole trip has changed now,\" Attar says. \"We are now going to do the trip in Deah and his wife's honor.\"</p>\n<p>Barakat, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and his sister-in-law, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were fatally shot near campus on Tuesday night, and a man with a history of hate speech, has been arrested in the crime.</p>\n<p>Barakat and his wife had a history of charity, both to the homeless in Chapel Hill and to refugees abroad. Facebook photos on Barakat's profile show him handing out food and dental supplies to Chapel Hill's homeless community just two weeks before they were killed.</p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_border cta_align-left cta_icon-engagement cta_align-right\" data-entity-id=\"72144\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-72144\" class=\"node node-story-act contextual-links-region story-act-cta story-act-nid-72144 cta-type-custom-text clearfix\" about=\"/node/72144\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/72144\">Story Act Get Involved Hate Crime</a></h2>\n<div class=\"contextual-links-wrapper\">\n<ul class=\"contextual-links\"><li class=\"node-edit first\"><a href=\"/node/72144/edit?destination=admin/content\">Edit</a></li>\n<li class=\"node-delete last\"><a href=\"/node/72144/delete?destination=admin/content\">Delete</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p><span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Story Act Get Involved Hate Crime\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    How Some People Are Showing Solidarity  </div>\n<div class=\"field-body\">\n<p>Deah Shaddy Barakat was coordinating a trip to a Syrian refugee camp in Turkey this summer, in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.sams-usa.net/foundation/\" target=\"_blank\">Syrian American Medical Society</a> (SAMS) and a group of dental students from the University of North Carolina- Chapel Hill. His goal was to raise $20,000 to provide dental supplies to refugees.
