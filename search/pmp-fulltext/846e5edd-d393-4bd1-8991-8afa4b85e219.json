Their wrongdoings allegedly included erasing incorrect test answers. It was hoped that higher test scores would help the schools meet test target goals, as well as secure promotions and cash bonuses.</p><p>The deals expected to be offered to 10 of the educators range from a year in jail with a $10,000 fine and five years probation to six months of weekends in jail and a $5,000 fine.
