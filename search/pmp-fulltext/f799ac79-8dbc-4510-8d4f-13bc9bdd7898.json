Earlier layoffs had reduced the workforce from approximately 2,500 before the recession.

And it’s still a living wage.”</p>\n<p>Back in 2005, Alaska Airlines outsourced its baggage-handler jobs to an airline-services contractor called Menzies Aviation. At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, nearly 500 union machinists were turned into non-union contract workers -- overnight.</p>\n<p>Their wages had averaged $13.40/hour at Alaska.
