Revenue management system means really complicated computer models.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>These models predict a lot of things: how many seats should the airline sell for cheaper to people who buy earlier? How many can it get away with setting aside in order to charge higher prices for last-minute business travelers? How many people won’t show up?

How long ago you bought your ticket, has it been ticketed, those all can be correlated with no show behavior,” says Belobaba.</span></p>\n<p><span>The cutting edge models, says ICF International’s Samuel Engel, also take into account the competing fares at any given moment from competitor airlines.
