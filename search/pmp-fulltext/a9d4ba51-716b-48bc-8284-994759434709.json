Of course, in the case of Boston -- as was the case in New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy -- the governor has organized a fund,\" says Berger.</p>\n<p>Berger says people have given a lot -- millions of dollars have already been raised. But how do you choose which charity to give to?</p>\n<p>\"A lot of it has to do with risk and expectations. The faster you want to see your money move, the higher the risk. If you're willing to wait a while, you lower your risk substantially, but the concern is victims and family need support right away. So it's a trade off. So there's no easy answer,\" says Berger. \"Our general recommendation is to go slow because then you know for certain it's a reputable organization with a track record or even a new organization like one organized by the governor and the mayor that has the gravitas that eventually the money will get there.
