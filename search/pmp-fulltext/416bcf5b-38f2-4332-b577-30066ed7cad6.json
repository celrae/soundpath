Think of \"<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/40759158\" target=\"_blank\">Hey Jude</a>,\" in which <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15229570/the-beatles\" target=\"_blank\">The Beatles</a> hammer the closing refrain for more than three minutes before drifting into silence.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2014/09/the_fade_out_in_pop_music_why_don_t_modern_pop_songs_end_by_slowly_reducing.html\" target=\"_blank\">In a recent Slate article</a>, music history and technology reporter William Weir says this used to be the popular way to end a pop song: Repeat your hook while the volume gradually eases off. Weir examined <em>Billboard</em>'s Top 10 songs for every year since 1946 to see where the technique popped up.</p><p>\"It peaked in 1985: Every one of the Top 10 songs of the year-end chart is a fade-out,\" he tells NPR's Robert Siegel. \"By the 1990s, you start seeing a noticeable decline. It just gets worse for the fade-out after that.\"</p><p>In fact, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/214471182/robin-thicke\" target=\"_blank\">Robin Thicke</a>'s \"Blurred Lines\" is the only major hit of the past several years <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyDUC1LUXSU&feature=youtu.be&t=4m11s\" target=\"_blank\">to fit the bill</a>. As NPR has covered before, the reason to add a fade-out varies from song to song. So, Weir says, does the artistry applied: <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15394818/the-beach-boys\" target=\"_blank\">The Beach Boys</a>' \"Caroline, No,\" for example, uses the opportunity to introduce a new element.</p><p>\"<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/14999155/brian-wilson\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Wilson</a> is meticulous about all recording aspects, so it shouldn't be surprising that he came up with some new ways to make the fade-out stand out,\" Weir says. \"Just as you think you've heard everything in the song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w7ZeSIC6K0&feature=youtu.be&t=1m36s\" target=\"_blank\">this bass flute takes prominence</a> in the last dwindling seconds. It really makes you pay attention all over again.\"</p><p>As studio tricks go, Weir says the fade-out is an easy one to pull off — but that hasn't always been the case.
