He died in 1978, and his grandson, Kiamichi-tet Williams, never got a chance to meet him.</p><p>On a visit to StoryCorps in Denver, Kiamichi-tet asked his dad, Thompson Williams, about his grandfather.</p><p>\"He wasn't the biggest guy, but people reacted to him like he was [a] giant,\" Thompson says. His father was a kindhearted man who wasn't afraid to cry, Thompson says.</p><p>\"When I was young, I came home one day and I said, 'Dad, I was told men don't cry.' He looked at me and he said, 'Son, that's a lie. If you don't cry, you don't get rid of that poison that's in your body, that hurt, that pain. That's the only way you can truly be strong.'</p><p>\"That was one of the most powerful things that I've learned from him,\" Thompson says.</p><p>Thompson recalls another powerful lesson he learned from his father at a young age: the importance of kindness.</p><p>When he was in grade school, Thompson says, he knew a child with intellectual disabilities. \"One day, there was a bunch of us and we started throwing bottle caps at him,\" Thompson says.</p><p>\"I picked one up and threw it â€” it smacked him in the head. I turned around and my dad was standing there. And I thought, 'Oops, I'm really in trouble now.' But he looked at me, tears in his eyes, and he said, 'Maybe I didn't teach you how to look after others. That's my fault.'</p><p>\"You know, he could've stabbed me in the heart and it wouldn't have hurt as much. I don't know, maybe that's why I became a special ed teacher,\" says Thompson, who is now the coordinator of Indian education for Jefferson County in Colorado. \"He had a lot of lessons that I hold onto to this day.\"</p><p><em>Audio produced for</em> Morning Edition <em>by Jud Esty-Kendall.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
