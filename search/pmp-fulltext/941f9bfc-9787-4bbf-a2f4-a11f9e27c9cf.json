Mike Pence says he wants legislation on his desk by the end of the week, clarifying that a new religious-freedom law does not allow discrimination.</p><p>Pence said Tuesday he has been meeting with lawmakers &#8220;around the clock&#8221; to address concerns that the law will allow businesses to deny services to gays and lesbians.</p><p>The law signed by Pence last week prohibits state laws that &#8220;substantially burden&#8221; a person&#8217;s ability to follow his or her religious beliefs. The definition of &#8220;person&#8221; includes religious institutions, businesses and associations.</p><p>Pence says the law has been &#8220;grossly mischaracterized&#8221; and has put Indiana under a harsh glare. Businesses and organizations including Apple and the NCAA have voiced concern over the effect of the law, and some states have barred government-funded travel to Indiana.</p><p><em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young speaks to <strong>Douglas NeJaime</strong>, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, about law and the governor&#8217;s remarks.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://law.ucla.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/douglas-nejaime/\" target=\"_blank\">Douglas NeJaime</a></strong>, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
