It’s also about romanticism about being a part of a new political state. This idea of being part of a new community and being taken seriously because what we’re seeing is that ISIS takes young people seriously. They take their politics seriously, they give them a voice, they give them credit, and that has a certain amount of appeal in a society, at least in Europe, where young people are not given the credibility that they might otherwise want.”</p><p><strong>On the message that ISIS is pushing towards women</strong></p><p>“I would say that the messages that ISIS is putting forward are not mainstream Islamic message at all. They’re not ones that you would find in the mosque. They’re not ones that you find ordinarily spoken. They’re definitely radical interpretations, but that also is appealing because it holds a degree of simplicity because it’s able to paint the world in black and white, and that makes it very easy to understand and believe in. Actually, like with all religions, it’s very complex. Islam like Christianity has a complex tradition of thinking, very different practices, ways of being Muslim, and ways of practicing Islam. I think what fundamentalism does is that it provides this simple black and white model that people find appealing.”</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/dsd/people/dsd-a-to-z/brown.aspx\"><strong>Katherine Brown</strong></a>, a professor in the Defence Studies Department at King&#8217;s College London.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
