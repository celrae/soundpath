You'll find that we had mixed reactions once you count the emotional beats, technical accomplishments, structure, editing, and — as Chris points out — high saline budget.</p><p>We figured we'd stay in the same celestial neighborhood for the whole show, so we next widened out to a larger conversation about space movies — not superhero/fantasy stuff, but the movies that really are trying to get at something at least reality-adjacent about where we might be headed and what we might find there. We talk about the aesthetic influences of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey </em>(and I mention <a href=\"http://jodorowskysdune.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a fine documentary</a> you might enjoy if your interests run to interplanetary production design), we consider analogies between space and water, we discuss the tension between claustrophobic space capsules and vast nothingness, and we remember that this isn't Matthew McConaughey's first time pondering the meaning of infinite space.</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about the goings-on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/music/?sc=re&cc=nprmusic\" target=\"_blank\">at his actual job</a>, particularly a very successful <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/359661053/t-pain-tiny-desk-concert?autoplay=true\" target=\"_blank\">video project</a>. (He's also happy about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor's_New_Groove\" target=\"_blank\">a movie</a> he caught with his kids, but what else is new with that guy?) Glen is happy about <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/internetarcade\" target=\"_blank\">an opportunity to play</a> (and play and play) right from your desk. Chris is happy about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TckJBvl_uT0\" target=\"_blank\">this trailer</a>, for reasons I'm still trying to understand. And I'm happy about a public radio classic that has new legs, but also perfectly good old legs.</p><p>Find us on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pchh\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> or follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nprmonkeysee\" target=\"_blank\">me</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/idislikestephen\">Stephen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ghweldon\" target=\"_blank\">Glen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ctklimek\" target=\"_blank\">Chris</a>, producer <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jessica_reedy\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica</a>, producer <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/lmigaki\">Lauren</a>, and our pal <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/mikekatzif\" target=\"_blank\">Mike</a>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
