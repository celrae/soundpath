He says buying a better seat, paying to board early like I did, there’s nothing wrong with that. “That’s a convenience, a service that the airlines are free to sell, and it’s not so terrible that money governs that.”</span></p><p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><span>But quicker access to the security line, that’s different.</span> <span>“<span>Because that, after all, is not a consumer service.  It’s for the common good.

Safe and secure, New York Life.&apos;”</span></p><p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><span>At first it’s just kind of irritating. But Sandel argues that the result of this constant intrusion of paid product announcements is that “the language of the game, the lyrical quality of the broadcast, is diminished.”</span></p><p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><span>When that happens, &quot;we lose our direct unfiltered relationship to the game, to the sounds, the rhythm of it.

Sandel worries that the wealthy in our modern society can lead very separate lives.</span></p><p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><span>“It’s no longer the case that everyone still stands in the same long lines for the restroom, or eats the same pretty inadequate food, and it&apos;s no longer true that when it rains, everyone gets wet,” he says.</span></p><p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"><span>This wouldn’t really matter if we were talking about just baseball games and airports.
