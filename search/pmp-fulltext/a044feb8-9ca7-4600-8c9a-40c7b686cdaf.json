If you've been to an Olive Garden recently, you know that's not the case. Starboard says waiters currently hand out breadsticks in excess, causing an enormous amount of waste. They think with fewer breadsticks on the table, waste will decrease and customers will have more room for appetizers and desserts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/file/pastapng\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Add salt</strong></a> To protect their pots, Olive Garden has stopped adding salt to the water it uses to cook pasta. This has significantly \"deteriorated\" the quality of Olive Garden's pasta which Starboard feels \"results in a mushy, unappealing product that is well below competitors' quality despite similar cost.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/file/slide-106png\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Stop dressing the salad</strong></a> The amount of waste produced from Olive Garden’s famous endless salad also concerns Starboard. They think “salads should be lightly dressed, potentially with a bottle of dressing placed on the side.”</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/file/slide-111png\" target=\"_blank\">Use cheaper containers</a>&nbsp;</strong> Darden uses containers that Starboard believes are the “Cadillacs” of the industry. To-go bags are made with high-end material. Takeout containers have their own luxurious factor by being microwavable and dishwasher safe. From a business standpoint, Starboard believes they should downgrade to at least a “Chevrolet Hatchback” of containers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/file/slide-118png\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Reduce menu options&nbsp;</strong></a> Starboard thinks the Olive Garden and Red Lobster menus have too many items on them, making the process of selecting a dish too complex. The complexity, in turn, has led to higher costs and inefficiencies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/file/slide-136png\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>An app…or some technology that appeals to&nbsp;millennials&nbsp;</strong></a> Darden’s brands need to adapt with the times in order to grow, argues Starboard. They suggest adding an app for their brands to appeal to younger customers. In their words: “Olive Garden is the 800-pound gorilla of Italian casual dining, but is a dinosaur when it comes to using technology in branding and marketing.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/file/slide-143png\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>A richer alcohol selection</strong></a> Starboard also thinks a change in the restaurants' wine selection is necessary. They believe Darden should pull wine from Italy, Napa and Washington, to name a few, because after all, “wine is an integral part of the authentic Italian family dining experience.”</p></div>","guid":"a044feb8-9ca7-4600-8c9a-40c7b686cdaf","teaser":"The activist hedge fund eyeing Darden's board suggests adding salt to pasta water.","byline":"Amy Scott","itags":["PMP:Marketplace_PMP","a044feb89ca76002c9a540c7b686cdaf","Marketplace","Marketplace for Friday September 12, 2014"],"published":"2014-09-12T21:14:07+00:00","tags":["APM","shareholders","Business","Darden","Olive Garden"],"title":"Writing a recipe for change at Olive Garden","contenttemplated":"[{\"content\":\"<p>Darden Restaurants helped put “casual dining” on the map with family-friendly chains like Olive Garden and, until the <a href=\\\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/why-darden-ditched-biscuits-and-not-breadsticks\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">company sold it this summer, Red Lobster</a>.
