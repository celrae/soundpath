Its become one of the most dangerous places to serve the honorable role of shedding light on what is going on in a humanitarian calamity. It&#8217;s tremendously dangerous. One of my students at Georgetown University was just one of those journalists and its hair-raising to think about what she and others have undergone. We were talking about the status of contractors not being full-time employees of the U.S. government and whether they are going to be protected the same way that a soldier or a full time USAID worker would be. So too, journalists rely on stringers and freelancers. There are lots of freelancers who are in danger.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/lagonm/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Lagon</a></strong>, global politics and security chair at the Master of Science in Foreign Service Program at Georgetown University.
