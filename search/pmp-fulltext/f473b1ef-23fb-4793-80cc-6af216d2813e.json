Last July, Buhari survived an attack on his convoy allegedly carried out by Boko Haram. Although he's is expected to do well among Muslim voters in Nigeria, Buhari's supporters fear voting may be difficult or impossible in those parts of the country where Boko Haram has its strongest presence.</p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_border cta_align-right\" data-entity-id=\"78834\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-78834\" class=\"node node-story-act story-act-cta story-act-nid-78834 cta-type-custom-text clearfix\" about=\"/node/78834\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/78834\">Watch this BBC video: How much has Nigeria changed since 1999?</a></h2>\n<p>    <span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Watch this BBC video: How much has Nigeria changed since 1999?\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    Watch this BBC video: How much has Nigeria changed since 1999?  </div>\n<div class=\"field-body\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32075281\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/forstoryact.jpg?itok=uiXaigYB\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The country’s oil-rich elite have meanwhile been pouring money into Goodluck Jonathan’s reelection campaign, even despite the administration's track record of graft. “The corruption under the Jonathan administration is kind of mind boggling for many Nigerians,\" says reporter <a href=\"http://juliaradio.com\">Julia Simon</a>.</p>\n<p>\"A year ago, the then-governor of the Central Bank said that the Nigerian Oil Ministry failed to remit $20 billion to the treasury,\" she says. \"There are still a lot of unanswered questions about that.

From Buhari's past as a military dictator, people know this is a man who has been capable of throwing his opponents in prison without qualms. For his part, though, Buhari now <a href=\"http://www.chathamhouse.org/event/prospects-democratic-consolidation-africa-nigerias-transition\">refers to himself</a> a “converted democrat.” </p>\n<p>The real issue for most Nigerian voters is more immediate than either security or corruption, says Julia Simon. People are feeling the pinch as their economy suffers a long drop in the price of oil. \"The Nigerian government relies on oil for 70 percent of its revenue, and with the oil price falling…that’s really bad news for the government,\" Simon says.</p>\n<p>Whatever the outcome, the US government is watching this election closely. The US Embassy in Nigeria recently uploaded a message direct from President Obama to Nigerian voters, urging a peaceful election. Judging from comments, some Nigerians appreciate the attention, but most commenters are deeply cynical about American interest and involvement — as well as the chances either candidate will solve the problems affecting Africa’s largest democracy.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VBY1H6o5d1E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-03-27%2Fnigerians-head-polls-presidential-election&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/03272015_01_0.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0327201501mp3-0"}]}
