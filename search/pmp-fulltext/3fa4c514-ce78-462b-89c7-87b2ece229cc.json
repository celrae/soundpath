And five different versions of the box set were available that included a mix of other live recordings, concert footage, remixes and music videos. With the recent opening of <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1501\" target=\"_blank\">MOMA's Björk retrospective</a> in New York, we thought it was a good opportunity to revisit another career-spanning conversation she had with us.</p><p>Shortly after <em>Voltaïc'</em>s release, Björk sat down for a memorable talk with <em>All Songs Considered </em>host Bob Boilen about her music, and to share songs by some of the artists who've inspired her over the years, including Syrian musician <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/106059336/omar-souleyman\" target=\"_blank\">Omar Souleyman</a>, the post punk duo Eyeless in Gaza, and fellow Icelandic singer <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/123494242/-l-f-arnalds\" target=\"_blank\">Ólöf Arnalds</a>.
