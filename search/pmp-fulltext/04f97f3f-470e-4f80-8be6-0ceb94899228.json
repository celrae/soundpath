Her fifth studio album “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R8SN5U4?tag=dinnerp-20\" target=\"_blank\">Short Movie</a>” came out on March 24. To celebrate, she offers up&nbsp;a soundtrack that starts small, gets weird, and ends in terrors.

He’s a Malian singer and guitarist. I was going to choose Fela Kuti but then I thought, you want to like&nbsp;<em>one up</em> your guests, and <em>everyone</em> knows Fela Kuti.</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/6iuqLHOj9so\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p>In my mind, the dinner party is in a beautiful apartment in Paris, and it would be just me and two other people which is like…&nbsp;sometimes it’s the best thing for a conversation, and sometimes the most awkward.</p>\n<br />\n<p>This song, I’d have it ready to go as people were arriving, so I’d keep putting it back to the beginning if people hadn’t arrived yet. I think it’s important to have a welcoming, happy soundtrack, but I’m going to weirder as the evening goes on.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Chilly Gonzales &nbsp;– “Manifesto”</h2>\n<br />\n<p>So, the next track is by a piano player called Chilly Gonzales. It’s called “Manifesto.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qdoz8SU_cI4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p>I first heard this song when I was living in L.A. actually, where I don’t live anymore, but an English friend of mine had come over. He was a piano player, and we were drinking wine together one evening. And he showed me a YouTube clip or something of this chap who came in out of nowhere into this crummy room and started playing this beautiful song on a crummy piano. And I just thought it was <em>extraordinary</em>.</p>\n<br />\n<p>This piece of music is incredibly evocative of something. You don’t really know what. It kind of evokes a memory that you’re not entirely sure is your own, and I think he’s actually a master of that, Chilly Gonzales. I feel like it’s the right setting for a candlelit, awkward dinner between three people.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Miles Davis &nbsp;– “Sivad”</h2>\n<br />\n<p>My next song of the evening would be Miles Davis, “Sivad.” I think that’s how you pronounce it. There’s a lot of use of wah pedals, and it sounds like a lot of instruments are talking at you, and if you were in the wrong state of mind it could push you over the edge.</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/PlNEjda734s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p>I collect records made in 1969. There was a lot of freedom in that year for some reason that people did a lot of experimenting. And this record, “Live-Evil,” is just the weirdest, like that would make you believe he was an alien, like he wasn’t from this planet. It sounds like the inner workings of a man on the edge of a breakdown. So, it would really push people into the surreal at the dinner party.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Laura Marling &nbsp;– “Warrior”</h2>\n<br />\n<p>If I was forced to play one of my own songs at a dinner party, which I think would make it the last dinner party that I’d ever be allowed to throw, I would play “Warrior,” and then send everyone home terrified.</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/cWy-EkpbPVk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p>It’s me doing a finger-picking part, and then we bowed an electric guitar and put it through a Memory Man. There’s quite a trippy, swooshing, panning, echoing thing going on in the background. So, it’s not an easy or sort of sweet listen. It wouldn’t be a good track for a dinner party now I think about it.</p>\n<br /></div>","itags":["04f97f3f470ef802be6c0ceb94899228","PMP:The_Dinner_Party_Download_PMP","The Dinner Party Download","The Dinner Party Download 2015-03-27"],"title":"Laura Marling Parties Like It’s 1969","tags":["APM","Soundtrack","music"],"byline":"Lopez, Kristina","description":"English folk singer Laura Marling burst on to the scene with her debut album “Alas, I Cannot Swim” in 2007.
