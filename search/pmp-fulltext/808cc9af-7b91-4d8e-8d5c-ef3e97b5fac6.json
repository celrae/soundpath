He stayed put, and, after a short time, the wind died out altogether, and the wolf heard the strumming. It was a guitar. It stopped and the wolf stood still until it started again. The wolf heard the girl trying out her voice, reedy and full of an emotion the wolf couldn’t grasp. There was never a way to tell, once music began, how long it would last. He was panting, and his breath was out of rhythm with the song.</p>\n<br />\n<p>The wolf got right under the window, pinned between the stucco and a line of tough shrubs. Now, he felt this girl’s song pressing on him pleasantly from without and within. The girl convinced her voice to rise with purpose, and the strumming rose with it. The wolf felt quick and dumb. This music could’ve been anywhere, and he could’ve been anywhere, but they were both here. The song was going to end, but that didn’t matter, because whenever it ended would be too soon. If it ended in a human minute, that would be too soon, and if it ended when morning broke, that would be too soon.</p>\n<br /></div>","contenttemplated":"[{\"content\":\"<p><em>My name is John Brandon.
