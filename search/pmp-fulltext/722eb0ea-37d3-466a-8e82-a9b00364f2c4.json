Think of a popular TV show about cooking â€” a show everyone has heard of. Remove the second and third letters of the first word and insert them after the first letter of the second word. The answer will be a phrase for a different kind of cooking. What is it?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> <em>Breaking Bad</em> (which is about cooking meth),<em> </em>baking bread</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> Rodrick Crider of Washington, D.C.</p><p><strong>Next week's challenge:</strong> Name something in five letters that's nice to have a lot of in the summer. Change the last letter to the following letter of the alphabet. Rearrange the result, and you'll name something else that you probably have a lot of in the summer, but that you probably don't want. What is it? (HINT: the second thing is a form of the first thing.)</p><p><a href=\"http://help.npr.org/npr/includes/customer/npr/custforms/contactus.aspx?pz=t\"><strong>Submit Your Answer</strong></a></p><p>If you know the answer to next week's challenge, submit it <a href=\"http://help.npr.org/npr/includes/customer/npr/custforms/contactus.aspx?pz=t\">here</a>.
