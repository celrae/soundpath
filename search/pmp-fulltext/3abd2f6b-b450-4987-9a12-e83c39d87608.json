It’s called <a href=\"http://aporee.org/maps/\">Aporee</a>, and it’s an online audio archive where people upload field recordings, a lot of them. It has almost 30,000 recordings, about 63 days worth of sound.</p>\n<p>On Aporee, you can listen to all kinds of things from across the globe. There are people beat-boxing in Kampala, Uganda:</p>\n<div class=\"mediaelement-audio media-element file-default\" info=\"%22media%22%7D\"><audio class=\"mediaelement-formatter-identifier-1432906910-0\" controls=\"controls\" src=\"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/Kampala.mp3\"> </audio></div>\n<p>Wildlife in the Amazon's Amacayacu National Park:</p>\n<div class=\"mediaelement-audio media-element file-default\" info=\"%22media%22%7D\"><audio class=\"mediaelement-formatter-identifier-1432906947-0\" controls=\"controls\" src=\"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/Amazon.mp3\"> </audio></div>\n<p>Metal workers in Kathmandu, Nepal:</p>\n<div class=\"mediaelement-audio media-element file-default\" info=\"%22media%22%7D\"><audio class=\"mediaelement-formatter-identifier-1432907026-0\" controls=\"controls\" src=\"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/Nepal.mp3\"> </audio></div>\n<p>And a firefight between military forces and rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo, among many others.</p>\n<div class=\"mediaelement-audio media-element file-default\" info=\"%22media%22%7D\"><audio class=\"mediaelement-formatter-identifier-1432907091-0\" controls=\"controls\" src=\"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/Congo.mp3\"> </audio></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://aporee.org/maps/export/?lat=42.356346&amp;lng=-71.148845&amp;zoom=19&amp;type=s&amp;locid=27994&amp;title=Boston%2C%20MA%2C%20USA\">And here's our recording</a> at The World studios at WGBH in Boston.</p>\n<p>Aporee was created by Udo Noll, a Berlin-based sound artist and programmer, who did it mostly because, well, it seemed cool to make a kind of living audio archive of the world.

Sidorjak records stuff he loves, like the creeks behind his house, waves on the Pacific Coast, birds in nearby parks — the kind of sounds you would expect. But lately he’s been recording different kinds of things — sounds that grate on him.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-image_on_right\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/CROPKarl.jpg?itok=8bnmKqOq\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Kark Sidorjak records sounds he loves, like the creeks behind his house, but he also wants to documents sounds from our \"urban environment,\" sounds he doesn't love.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Sam Harnett</p>\n  </div>\n</div>Sidorjak takes me to a recycling center where he’s been doing some recording.\n<p>“This is kind of the guts of the urban environment,” he says. “You can hear it too.”</p>\n<p>We dump a bucket of his beer bottles into a metal bin and it makes a horrible crash — a beer avalanche, Sidorjak calls it. He has his recorder on to capture the sound; I have my recorder on to capture him.</p>\n<p>High on Sidorjak's list of terrible noises are automated telephone systems, so he records them too. He also has a whole series on Home Depots. He says he's noticed the incessant background music is different at each one and seems to reflect the local demographics.</p>\n<p>As you can probably tell, Sidorjak is sensitive to noise and recording, he says, is a way to deal with it. He can concentrate on gathering the sounds and that helps keep them from driving him crazy.</p>\n<p>Sidorjak says he thinks it’s important to have audio on Aporee that really shows the kind of soundscape many of us live in, even if it is annoying and unpleasant.</p>\n<p>“It's just plain bad, you know, the sound environment we spend a lot of time in,” he says.</p>\n<p>After he makes the recordings, Sidorjak loads them onto the map — and there they are, the Home Depots and recycling centers alongside the birds and creeks and waves, those sounds many of us probably hear far less frequently than we would like.</p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-05-28%2Fheres-what-map-world-sounds&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/05292015_08.mp3"},{"href":"http://admin.pri.org/file/0529201508mp3"}]}
