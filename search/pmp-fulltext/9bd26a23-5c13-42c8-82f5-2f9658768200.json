Gilbert argues that in the same way optical illusions fool our eyes, our brains systematically misjudge what will make us happy. His 2006 book <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/books/titles/138347636/stumbling-on-happiness\">Stumbling on Happiness</a> was a <em>New York Times</em> best-seller and has been translated into 20 languages.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
