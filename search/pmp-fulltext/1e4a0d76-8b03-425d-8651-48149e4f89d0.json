And I have even had letters from people who told me their relatives were charging them for Thanksgiving dinner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Oh my goodness.<a href=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Miss-Manners-Minds-Your-Business.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"Miss Manners Minds Your Business\" src=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Miss-Manners-Minds-Your-Business-197x300.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Wow. So what is your advice? How do we break out of this cycle?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> Well, it’s of course context-specific. What is the situation? But generally: have a private life and a professional life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I’ve worked with Rico for years, and he doesn’t know my real telephone number, so…</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> Good for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s right.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> He just found that out.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> He can’t call you in the middle of the night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> All right, our listeners have submitted some questions for you. Some of them relate to the workplace, others don’t, so let’s begin.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>“Hanging out” is not your job, and the lost art of discretion.</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> We’re gonna start with a question from Islay. She contacted us via Facebook, and she says, “I adore some of my workmates and find others irritating to no end. How do I engage in activities with the coworkers I do enjoy, without alienating the ones I don’t like? Note, the undesired coworkers are overly zealous to hang out, and they are upset when they are not included.” So this is getting right to your point right here.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> Yes, and I’m assuming the ‘activities’ and the ‘hanging out’ are not another way of saying work. You have to <em>work</em> with them whether you like them or not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> I can’t fire my coworkers? What’s wrong with this world?</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> One thing is, don’t stand in the middle of the office and say, “Let’s all go out for drinks,” and then say, “You, you, and not you.” Keep it private, don’t post it on Facebook, and don’t make a general announcement. You quietly arrange to meet the people you like on your own time.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> What happens is one of the other coworkers says, “What are you doing after work?” And they’re like, “Oh I’m gonna go out with Rico and Brendan.” And that person says “Why don’t I get to hang out with those cool dudes? That’s not fair.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> Oh, you <em>don’t</em> <em>say</em> “I’m gonna hang out with these people.” You say “I’m busy.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s it. In a way you’re kind of being secretive. Don’t let them know where you’re going.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> It’s being discrete.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> Yes, discretion. A lost art, by the way, in many respects. There was always a rule that you don’t discuss social events in front of people who are not invited.</p>\n<br />\n<p>This has been totally demolished by people posting their social events online for everybody to know. Not a good idea, because people do resent being left out. So you make your arrangements discretely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> And also you could wear disguises if you’re going somewhere nearby.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote data-pullquote=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> <q>You could wear a paper bag over your head, yes, but it is very hard to drink with a paper bag over your head.</q></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<h2>On cyber-security and other convenient excuses.</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> All right, so we have another question, this one comes from Matthew. He sent it to us via Facebook. Matthew writes, “I have a question for Miss Manners: I’ve recently started an internship, and instead of providing me with a computer, they’ve asked that I bring in my own laptop and have them download all of their stuff onto it. This is a big company, so it’s not like they can’t afford to give me a computer. Is there a polite and professional way to tell them that I don’t feel comfortable taking over my computer for a temporary internship?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p>J<strong>udith Martin:</strong> Unless this person was told that bringing a laptop is part of the job, I very much sympathize with the fact that he doesn’t want to use it – but he’s not in a very strong position as an intern.</p>\n<br />\n<p>I think what I would do is say, you know, “I use my personal laptop for a lot of different things, and I can’t guarantee that everything concerning work would be kept confidential.” And that ought to scare them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Yeah, but Miss Manners, that is a bit of a lie. You could say that to maybe get them to give you a computer–</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> It’s not a lie at all! Everything that goes on a computer – you know this – is going to be available to somebody.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> He’s using that as an excuse. He really just doesn’t want to do it because he doesn’t like it.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote data-pullquote=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> <q>In the etiquette business, we don’t use that term, <em>lie</em>, the way you do.</q></p>\n<br />\n<p>There are ways of saying things that spare people’s feelings, that are effective, and so on, gentle ways of saying things, that are extremely valuable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> So I’ve learned today that I can be immodest, I can lie…</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> No you haven’t. No you haven’t, come on. You have not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> All right, this has been a real education.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> You have <em>not</em> learned those things from me.</p>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<h2>All is fair in love and etiquette-gang wars.</h2>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> We know.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Here’s the last question, and actually this is from us. Regular listeners to the show know that we often have Lizzie and Daniel from the Emily Post Institute here to answer etiquette questions.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> They’re the great-great-grandkids of Emily Post.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That is right, and our question is: is it impolite to be having you on our show?</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Should we be loyal to the Posts?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> I’m sure that in the etiquette business, we do not have those kinds of rivalries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Really, you don’t fight?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> We <em>all</em> recognize that there’s a tremendous etiquette crisis going on. The more of us who pitch in, the better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> So you ‘re like an army basically. Together, you form an army of politeness.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> Except we’re very poorly armed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> So you guys aren’t rival gangs? You don’t have really polite duels on occasion?<a href=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Martin-Judith-and-Nicholas-Ivor-c-Rebecca-Toon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"Martin, Judith and Nicholas Ivor (c) Rebecca Toon\" src=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Martin-Judith-and-Nicholas-Ivor-c-Rebecca-Toon-300x225.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> No rumbles.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith Martin:</strong> Certainly not.
