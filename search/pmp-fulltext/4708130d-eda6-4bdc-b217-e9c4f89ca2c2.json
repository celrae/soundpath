It's a fact well known to students of French literature and marketing executives.</p><p>And it's changing the make-up of the cereal aisle. Thanks to the power of food nostalgia, General Mills is bringing back the sugary cereal French Toast Crunch.</p><p>Nick Fereday, the executive director and senior analyst of food and consumer trends at Rabobank International, tells NPR's Arun Rath that nostalgia is an important weapon in a marketer's arsenal.</p><p>\"It's one of those standard things that companies like to play with every now and again to lure customers back to their products,\" Fereday says.</p><p>The return of French Toast Crunch seems aimed squarely at millennials. One of General Mills' new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbnZ_ZCKw2Q\">online ads featuring '90s call-in psychic Miss Cleo</a>.</p><p>Fereday says marketers like to find a story to tell about their product and nostalgia is a great way of doing that. It's all about making a connection.</p><p>\"One of the challenges for the millennial generation is that it's a much more diverse group than generations before,\" he says. \"So, for example, not everyone may know who the horoscope lady is ... in a way that 40 or 50 years ago ... everyone knew who the cartoon characters were.\"</p><p>Fereday says it's interesting that food companies are essentially looking to the consumer for ideas, which he says might indicate a lack of innovation on their part. Historically, he says, breakfast cereals were a tremendous success story for over 100 years. But in the last five to 10 years they've been on the decline.</p><p>\"It's really a struggle that's not just affecting breakfast cereal but also a lot of traditional foods in the American diet,\" he says.</p><p>But marketers can't point to one particular cause, he says, so instead it's been a variety of different things. A \"death by a thousand cuts,\" he says.</p><p>To remedy this, Fereday says that's why we're seeing a number of approaches: re-launching old products like French Toast Crunch, selling Cheerios with no GMOs, and putting out Cheerios with protein and even quinoa.</p><p>\"I mean, kale will be next, I guess,\" he says. \"They're trying lots of different things and hoping that something will stick.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
