That’s what Chuck Palahniuk discovered. He grew up in a part of southeastern Washington, called the Tri-Cities—after the trio of cities clustered along the Columbia River: Richland, Pasco and Kennewick.

And theTri-Cities are still shaped by the odd hybrid of farming the soils of the region-- and plutonium production. Every episode of State of the Re:Union, we ask residents to write a letter to the place they live. Chuck, who’s the author of Fight Club, and several other books, writes that, with time even things you never appreciated become oddly… perfect.","description":"Sometimes you don't know how perfect a place is... until you've left it.
