The country is now split between two governments: an Islamist-led government in control of Tripoli, and a democratically-elected parliament trying to govern from the far east of the country, backed by rival militias.</p><p>With this power and security vacuum, extremist militants have been able to gain ground in the country. Just this week, ISIS militants seized full control of the key coastal city of Sirte; they&#8217;re now advancing on Misrata.
