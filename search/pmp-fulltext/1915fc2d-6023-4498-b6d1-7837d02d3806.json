In every case, he was building support for his policies, not the other way around. In 2002, he made himself available to anyone who wanted to hear his proposal to eliminate slush funds that wasted millions of taxpayer dollars as well as his opposition to a proposed tax increase on middle-class families. He has never been affiliated with the abhorrent group in question. The hate-fueled ignorance and intolerance that group projects is in stark contradiction to what Mr. Scalise believes and practices as a father, a husband, and a devoted Catholic.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>NPR&#8217;s <strong>Ron Elving</strong> joins <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org\"><em>Here & Now&#8217;</em></a>s Lisa Mullins to discuss whether the political scandal will have any implications for the new Congress.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/people/1930203/ron-elving\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Ron Elving</strong></a>, a senior editor and correspondent with NPR. He tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/relving\" target=\"_blank\">@relving</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
