In addition, anti-Christian prejudice is intense in the Turkish media.</p><p>Moreover, Turkey bans the training of Orthodox priests, and makes it very hard for foreign clergy to get residency or work permits.</p><p>\"It is of course very sad story because this is a negation of the basic right of religious freedom. If you don't have the formation of clergy, how can you sustain a church life? It is impossible,\" says Mustafa Aydin, a Turk who heads a center for inter-faith dialogue in Rome.</p><p>And there's the issue of the Orthodox seminary that's been shut down since 1971 â€“ despite Turkish President Recep Erdogan's promises that it would be re-opened.</p><p>John Allen, longtime Vatican analyst, now with the<em> Boston Globe</em>, says the pope has the opportunity to challenge the president publicly.</p><p>\"(He can) look at Erdogan in the eyes and say, 'Mr. Erdogan, re-open this seminary,'\" Allen says. \"That will become the litmus test as to whether Erdogan is truly serious about protecting religious pluralism and protecting Turkey's secular moderate heritage.\"</p><p>Just across Turkey's borders, fighting rages in what Pope Francis has called the \"fragmented Third World War.\"</p><p>\"It is a world war in bits and pieces with many spots of crisis,\" says veteran Vatican analyst Marco Politi. Politi expects the pope will reiterate his vehement denunciations of the so-called Islamic State that has carried out massacres of Christians, Muslims and other minorities in the region.</p><p>\"Certainly Pope Francis will stress the distinction between Islam as religion and violent, terrorist, fundamentalist groups who abuse and manipulate religion for political purposes,\" he says.</p><p>But it's the dwindling number of Christians in the Middle East who will be listening most closely to what the pope has to say, says John Allen.</p><p>\"Is he going to be able to move the ball in some concrete way to give Christians in Turkey and Christians in Middle East a sense that they have a future in this region,\" Allen says. \"Right now the vast majority of them, they feel that they have been given a death sentence, and most of them are looking for ways to get out.\"</p><p>Francis has also expressed interest in a visit to border areas near Iraq or Syria to meet refugees. Up to now, Turkish officials have ruled it out on the grounds of security.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
