Here’s something from Maya in Nashville, Tennessee. Maya writes:</p>\n<br />\n<p>“I am a half Indian, half white-Jewish-South African. My co-workers and friends will sometimes try to correct me about my own culture and cultural experiences. Things like ‘…but <em>real</em> Indians X, Y, or Z.’ How should I respond without seeming uptight?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Maz Jobrani:</strong> Maya, it’s very simple. &nbsp;You’re right — you’ve got to walk a tightrope here, right? So you’ve got to come back with like, “Listen, <em>half</em> of me agrees with you. The other half? &nbsp;Not so much!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> It’s wild though: Basically, Maya is getting in trouble for not confirming stereotypes, it sounds like.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Oh yeah, that’s interesting.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> “No, no, you’re supposed to like spicy food, Maya! At least half of you.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Maz Jobrani:</strong> That’s probably where this happened. It was probably a spicy curry sauce and she’s like “I’m not going to!” &nbsp;And then her friends were like, [with a blase accent] “But real Indians eat spicy curry sauce all the time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Is that what a real Indian sounds like? That’s interesting.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> That’s what people in Nashville, Tennessee sound like.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Maz Jobrani:</strong> Yeah, [with same blase accent] &nbsp;They talk like this in Nashville, Tennessee all the time! And then the Indians in Nashville, Tennessee talk like this: [same accent] “No we don’t! We <em>don’t</em> always eat spicy food!”</p>\n<br />\n<p>I’m very good with accents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s really good.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Yeah, you’re excellent.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Maz Jobrani:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> It’s frightening.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Can you do a Saudi prince?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Maz Jobrani:</strong>&nbsp;[same accent] “Hi! I’m a Saudi Prince!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> <em>Nailed</em> it! &nbsp;Maz Jobrani, thank you so much for telling our audience how to behave.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Maz Jobrani:</strong> Of course. Any time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br /></div>","teaser":"Brendan Francis Newnam: Each week you send in your questions about how to behave, and here to answer them this week is comedian Maz Jobrani.
