There can be truth to those critiques, but they can also feel like poorly veiled cultural elitism.</p><p>If you listen to <em>Alt.Latino</em> regularly, you know that I'm a big fan of pop music. It's the area where co-host Felix Contreras and I differ most often. I think it's in part because I came into music as a young dancer — whereas Felix first approached it as a musician — so I appreciate a plain old good, danceable song.</p><p>Felix was out on vacation this week, and you know what they say about what happens when the cat's away. So while Don Gato Felix was out, I invited in my friend <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/ximenamor\">Ximena Mor</a>, a vocal coach on <em>The Voice (La Voz) Mexico</em>. Ximena and I share a passion for music, and she may well be a bigger pop fan than me. We've had many conversations with each other about music — and about why Latin pop stars often get criticized unfairly.</p><p>We decided to take those conversations on the air: I asked Ximena to bring in a handful of the Latin pop artists she respects for their vocal talents, and to explain what she, as a vocal coach, hears when she tunes into Luis Miguel, David Bisbal or Ricky Martin. When she asked me about our show, I said that <em>Alt.Latino</em> listeners are true music lovers, and that she shouldn't hesitate to nerd out about the voices, rhythms, melodies and beats. T<em></em>hat's exactly what we did.</p><p>This week's show is a huge treat for me: I get to hang out with a friend I've been wanting to introduce to our listeners, I get to listen to pop, and I get to speak Spanish on the air — a rare but much-appreciated pleasure. If you don't speak Spanish, I recommend listening to the music and soaking in that beautiful linguistic dance between a <em>chilanga </em>and a <em>porteña</em>.</p><p>We always look forward to hearing from you, and if you have questions for Ximena Mor, you can reach her <a href=\"@XimenAmor\">here</a>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
