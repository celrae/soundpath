But this week is a special treat, as some of <em>Alt.Latino</em>'s favorite new artists release new music that's driving us crazy (in a good way). We also celebrate the 20th anniversary of Cafe Tacvba's album <em>Re</em> — a crucial, seminal record that changed Latin music as we know it.</p><p>Any lover of contemporary Latin music will tell you that when <em>Re </em>came out, there was a moment of pause: <em>This </em>is how Latin rock is supposed to sound. It's cool to hear \"El Aparato\" alongside newer artists who were clearly inspired by the Mexican music legends.</p><p>As if that weren't enough to have us happily humming throughout the week, we've got an interview about the new film <em>The Book Of Life</em> with NPR's Mandalit Del Barco. Not only does the film look stellar, but it also features a spine-tingling rendition of Cafe Tacvba's \"El Aparato.\"</p><p>So join us for another jam-packed, dance-inducing episode of <em>Alt.Latino</em> — and, as always, let us know what you think in the Comments.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
