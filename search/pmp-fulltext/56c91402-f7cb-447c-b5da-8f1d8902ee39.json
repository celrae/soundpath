A man with a knife was \"acting erratically,\" and was killed by police after not complying with orders, Metropolitan Police Chief Sam Dotson said. The incident is apparently not connected to the protests, but shortly after the shooting a crowd gathered, chanting, \"Hands up! Don't shoot!\"</p><p>-- School has been canceled for the rest of the week, but <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/08/19/341651494/ferguson-teachers-use-day-off-as-opportunity-for-a-civics-lesson\">NPR's Elise Hu reports</a> that Tuesday morning, \"150 area teachers took part in some unusual professional development: picking up broken glass, water bottles and tear gas canisters from the street.\"</p><p>-- The Pentagon defended a program that gives local law enforcement agencies surplus military equipment, NPR's Tom Bowman reports. The program, which dates back to 1988, has come under criticism because of what some have called the military-style police response in Ferguson. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said the program has helped in counterdrug and other operations. He also said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has asked for more information on the program, though he has not ordered an official review.</p><p><strong>What to watch for Tuesday night into Wednesday:</strong></p><p>-- Overnight protests and potential violence.
