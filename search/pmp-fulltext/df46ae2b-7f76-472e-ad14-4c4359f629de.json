A documentary which will be shown on the BBC on International women's day, tells the story of the brutal gang rape and murder of the 23 year old.  The film maker, Leslie Udwin said she wanted to tell this story to try and understand why men rape? The film examines the values and mindsets of the rapists.  One of them, Mukesh Singh says \"women who go out at night, only have themselves to blame.\" We speak to Leslie Udwin and a group of Indians to discus whether attitudes towards women in India have changed since the attack.","itags":["npr_api","390512119"],"contentencoded":"<p><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 MPX.
