Szifron says he can't really choose a favorite story. \"I love them all, I mean, they are like kids for me — different kids,\" he says. \"I always think of these short stories as vital organs of the same being. So it's not that I can take one out. They all make the movie live.\"</p><p>Szifron tells Rath about the accidental origins of the movie and a moment when he too lost control.</p><hr /><h3>Interview Highlights</h3><p><strong>On how the film came together</strong></p><p>This was an accidental movie for me. I was working on a science fiction trilogy, then I was working a Western and a love story — all at the same time. And so to the new ideas that kept on coming, I tried to compress them to stop them from becoming more feature films. So, as a result, I got these powerful short stories. By the time that I had three or four I discovered that they were all connected and that they all came from the same DNA — that DNA: the pleasure of reaction, the pleasure of losing control.</p><p><strong>On the extreme, yet relatable elements of each story</strong></p><p>This is a film that, for me, is very real. Of course there's a lot of fiction in it and you experience it as if you were watching episodes from <em>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</em> or <em>Twilight Zone</em> or <em>Amazing Stories</em>. But also this is talking, I think, a lot about us. The pleasure of reacting, the pleasure of losing control. I thought of that idea a lot while directing the actors because everything is dramatic but the audience is laughing out loud. So there's something in the middle and I would say that is the pleasure of reaction toward injustice, toward abuse of power, of letting your instincts drive your behavior. There's a particular moment in which all characters cross lines that they enjoy it and we do as well.</p><p><strong>On a moment when he became unhinged</strong></p><p>I did something a few years ago that I didn't know I was capable of before. Which is I got involved in a fight, in fistfight with two guys and I am not that kind of guy. ... But I was with my wife in a restaurant and it doesn't matter why and I had to do a probation after that for a year ... I had to give cinema lessons to people of low resources, which I enjoyed a lot, I have to say. But I know that there's a point in which you can reach that breaking point. We all can. ... I think I know myself more now and it's not that I succeed[ed] in that fight ... I end up in the hospital as well as the other guys, but to know that you can get there and there's a point in which you lose your fear.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
