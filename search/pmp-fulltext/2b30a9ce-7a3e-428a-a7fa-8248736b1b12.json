So she was asked to help with another job: standing at the main gate of the walled-in compound, turning people away when the unit was full.</p><p>For five weeks, she gave people the bad news.</p><p>Petersen says there are some people she will never forget — like the man who sat in the rain all day, waiting. \"We had no space — he just asked for a place to lie down,\" she says. \"At the end of the day I could take him in ... he died two days later.\"</p><p>Other people died in front of the gate, still waiting to get in.</p><p>Petersen finished that stint in Liberia in early October; now she's back in the country again. These days there are fewer cases in Monrovia — but still many cases in rural areas, where people can't reach an Ebola treatment unit.</p><p>So this time, Petersen is no longer at the front gate; she's back at her old job, managing supplies.</p><p><em>Click on the audio link above to hear more about Petersen's experience being forced to turn away the ill.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
