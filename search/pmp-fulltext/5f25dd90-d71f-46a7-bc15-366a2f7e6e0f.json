But it's possible that if you came back to that same place the next day, that graffiti would be gone.</p><p>The City of Los Angeles has an office of community beautification that targets graffiti — not the artistic graffiti or wall murals, but gang tags.</p><p>Larry Bender is one of many so-called graffiti busters contracted by the city. His adventures were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9qx8nq3TsY\">recently documented</a> on the web series, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/tomexploresla\">Tom Explores Los Angeles</a>.</p><p>\"I started this just about 20 years ago,\" Larry Bender says. \"A lot of people say 20 years too long, but I love the job.\"</p><p>He drives a loud, beat-up utility truck covered with splotches of paint. Inside, there's paint everywhere — plastered on his steering wheel, patterned on his seats. Bender himself is covered in it.</p><p>His truck is equipped with a high-pressure washer and an airless paint sprayer. Here in Highland Park, north of downtown, he's ready for anything.</p><p>\"We're out before people see us or even know we're around quite often. Either they're on their way to work or are asleep or whatever,\" he says. \"There's a whole army of people like me out there doing this. Hundreds and hundreds of people all over the city. A ragtag army of graffiti busters out here.\"</p><p>Bender gets an early start at 4:30 in the morning to beat the traffic. The first wall he passes looks like he's painted over it a million times. Now, there's another tag.</p><p>\"I just painted that same thing out yesterday,\" he says.</p><p>Bender hops out of his truck and gets to work. The bed of his truck is his painting palette — five-gallon paint buckets, all city colors to match the walls, piled up around traffic cones, paint brushes and rollers. With one pass over the wall, the graffiti disappears.</p><p>But Bender knows he'll probably be back here tomorrow painting over the same thing.</p><p>\"Right there? There's our tag, I can get it right here,\" he says. Just down the block, another sighting. \"I've painted this wall several times so I know what it is. [I can] sleepwalk it.\"</p><p>This week, Bender says he's inundated with requests from residents. There's a lot of graffiti going up in this neighborhood lately.</p><p>\"A gang member died two days ago and you'll see gang tags go up all over the place,\" he says. \"Yesterday, it was plastered.\"</p><p>When your job is to paint over gang signs, Bender says there are some risks.</p><p>\"I saw four guys right up on me going full-speed,\" he says. \"First reaction: pull the trigger on the airless [sprayer].\"</p><p>A cloud of paint is his only defense, but he rarely needs it these days.</p><p>\"Things have gotten a lot better out here,\" Bender says. \"A lot calmer.\"</p><p>He doesn't see most taggers, or know who they are, but these walls provide some kind of contact. Bender remembers one person he knew — in a way — through a yellow traffic sign.</p><p>\"This kid would take a Sharpie and tag it,\" he says. \"Every day. Every single day for a couple years, I would come by and wipe it out. The next day, there it would be again.\"</p><p>Then, one day, Bender came back to the sign and the tag wasn't there.</p><p>\"What happened, I don't know. Maybe he moved away, maybe he just got tired of it,\" he says. \"I kinda missed it, you know? I looked forward to getting this tag everyday. It was like losing an old friend or something.\"</p><p>But in this line of work, there's no time to get nostalgic. Bender spots another tag. His utility truck roars, and he's back on the hunt.</p><p><strong>Updated March 26, 2015:</strong></p><p>This story was updated to include information about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/tomexploresla\">Tom Explores Los Angeles</a>, which was the inspiration for the piece.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
