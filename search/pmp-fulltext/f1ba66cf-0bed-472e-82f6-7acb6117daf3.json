Rob, our CEO, came up with the original formula and he lived on it for 30 days.&nbsp; So that’s where this all began.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Sure, but I mean, where did he come up with it? Did he just kind of test out every possible combination of nutritional supplement until he came up with one he could live off?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> So there are a lot of studies that show what ideal nutrient proportions are.

It’s a powder and oil, and you mix those with a certain ratio of water, and that is the proportion that everyone gets. It seems to me that everybody has different nutritional needs. Some people are iron-deficient, some people will naturally eat more of something because their body demands it. Is this really a one-size-fits-all substance?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> It’s as close as one-size-fits-all can get. As far as iron deficiency or wanting to eat more, it has a ton of iron from added vitamins as well as natural iron in the rice protein. And as far as eating more, you can always mix up another bag of Soylent; it’s one calorie per milliliter. One of co-founders, John, is 6’8”, and he needs about 3,800 calories per day sometimes when he’s very active.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Are there side effects? I had read somewhere that gas was an issue for some people.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> That can be an issue for some people. And it was especially an issue in early iterations of the product, when high qualities of sulfur were involved. And that was quickly, er, <em>addressed</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> I can imagine!&nbsp; That’s what beta testing is for.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> It is! There was a bug in the product.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Are you subsisting on this entirely?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> Not entirely; it makes up the bulk of my meals. I do breakfast and I do lunch pretty much every day. Especially weekdays. I find it very easy to wake up in the morning and mix up a pitcher of Soylent. I don’t have to worry about what’s for lunch or what I’m gonna get. I don’t have to leave my desk if I don’t want to. It’s a problem that’s just solved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> But I guess that’s what gets me: this idea of stopping to eat food as a “problem” that needs to be “solved.” I understand that sometimes it’s an inconvenience, but, like your CEO, there’s a whole subculture of people who want to subsist on this for long periods of time.&nbsp;I don’t know why, but it feels worrisome to me. I think about the movie “Brazil,”&nbsp;where they’re in a fine restaurant and everybody’s ordering variations on the same lifeless paste. It’s almost like the definition of a totalitarian society. Is the goal here&nbsp;really to eradicate the need for food?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote data-pullquote=\"q\">\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> We’ve heard that concern before. <q>It’s not so much us wanting to <em>replace</em> food as much as wanting to replace a staple meal and make food more <em>convenient</em>.</q> And you can replace meals that you don’t enjoy. I don’t know what that I might be for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Oh, there are no meals that I don’t enjoy, unfortunately!</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> Well, for me, junk food is something that I try to get away from, and I find Soylent is very useful in helping me avoid that. But I still very much enjoy going out to a nice restaurant where there’s a dish that is almost more of an <em>art</em> than a meal that I would need to subsist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> You mentioned trying to get away from junk food. Something that would satisfy you beside junk food. Is it satisfying?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> Absolutely — incredibly satisfying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano</strong>: Even though it doesn’t have a chew to it? I did an interview with a guy who did a certain type of cleanse and he found that after a week he was really yearning to <em>chew</em> something.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> We have heard that some people miss the urge to chew, and we recommend that they chew gum.&nbsp; But we don’t recommend they consume unhealthy calories, just to satisfy a mechanical urge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> All right, well let me taste some of this.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> Sure. We brought you some here. &nbsp;It’s in a 2-liter pitcher …</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong>&nbsp; … and it’s kind of beige.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote data-pullquote=\"q\">\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> <q>It is beige. We purposely designed it to be very neutral. For taste and texture.</q> If this is something that you’re gonna to have for a large percentage of your meals, you would get tired of something that has a very extreme texture or taste.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> So it’s gonna be somewhat <em>bland</em> I guess, is what you mean by “neutral.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> Yes, but I prefer “deliciously neutral.” And an advantage there is that you can customize it by blending it up with berries or peanut butter, and everybody has their take on it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> OK.&nbsp; Although when you start doing that, you’re kind of missing the point, it seems like.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Renteln:</strong> Well, since it’s so amenable to customization in terms of taste, you wouldn’t actually have to blend very many berries, for instance. The nutrition wouldn’t really change very much.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"SoylentPouch2\" src=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/SoylentPouch2-714x1024.jpg\" /><br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Initially smelling it, it smells a little bit like protein powders that I’ve had after a workout or something like that.</p>\n<br />\n<p>[sips it]</p>\n<br />\n<p>It is very neutral.

We have other people who really want to use this for, say, a camping experience.
