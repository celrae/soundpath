How? Well, because of all the stuff you have to buy for it. If you have a dog you need a collar, a leash, a toy bone, etc. Well, I've got three iPod's and I can tell you that it gets expensive buying the covers, the arm band for the Shuffle, and on and on. Today, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs addresses the faithful, there's a rumor he may announce a new version of the iPod. Marketplace's Brett Neely says that will be \"sweet music\" for a brand-new industry that provides all those cool accessories.\n<hr />\n<strong>BRETT NEELY:</strong> Whenever Steve Jobs announces a new iPod, he plays it down as no big deal.\n<blockquote><strong>STEVE JOBS:</strong> But there is one more thing . . .</blockquote>\nBut for the companies that make accessories for iPods it is. Think cases, car chargers, speaker systems that plug into the music player.<br />\n<br />\nIt's a market that some analysts estimate is worth nearly a billion dollars a year.<br />\n<br />\nGavin Downey runs the accessory business for one of the industry's biggest players. It's a California company called Belkin.\n<blockquote><strong>GAVIN DOWNEY:</strong> People really look to personalize their iPods, for every iPod sold the number of cases sold has continued to skyrocket. It has about a 40 percent attach rate.</blockquote>\nIn English, a 40 percent attach rate means consumers snap up four cases for every 10 iPods sold.<br />\n<br />\nDowney's market research says iPod consumers spend on average about $110 buying extra stuff for their new toys.<br />\n<br />\nBut it's not an easy business to be in. Apple reveals nothing about upcoming products to outsiders. Ever.<br />\n<br />\nApple doesn't want competitors to get a whiff of what they're up to, so, Downey's staff has to read the tea leaves.\n<blockquote><strong>DOWNEY:</strong> You keep your ear to the ground in terms of components.</blockquote>\nThat helps Downey figure out things like the size and capabilities of new products.<br />\n<br />\nTed Schadler's a technology analyst with Forrester Research. He says once Apple speaks, accessory makers jump.\n<blockquote><strong>TED SCHADLER:</strong> Usually people have a year, six months or three months to plan for their next product launch. Here we've got a turnaround of weeks in order to get product to market.</blockquote>\nIn some cases, it's just days.<br />\n<br />\nJim Scherrer runs a small accessory company called Pacific Rim Marketing with his brother. Right after the iPod Nano was released, he noticed that the device scratched easily.<br />\n<br />\nScherrer figured there was money in selling lots of transparent covers.\n<blockquote><strong>JIM SCHERRER:</strong> We found the manufacturer in the morning, made friends with him in 10 minutes. Fed-Exed him a Nano and told him what we needed.</blockquote>\nAnd within three days, they were selling the Opticover Scratch Protector on the company Web site.<br />\n<br />\nJim's brother, Fred, lives in Asia where he oversees the manufacturing. They speak at least four times a day, starting at about 4 a.m. in California<br />\n<br />\nThe brothers use Apple's built-in video chat software on their PowerBooks to show each other product designs.<br />\n<br />\nJim says running the business together has worked wonders for their relationship.\n<blockquote><strong>SCHERRER:</strong> Yeah for about 15 years we really never talked, we might see each other every three or four Christmases. And this, you know, brought us all back together.</blockquote>\nIf Apple does release a new iPod later today, the brothers say they'll start designing their new cases immediately.<br />\n<br />\nIn Los Angeles, I'm Brett Neely for</div>","itags":["87b63fc0635107ce6f713b0ae8efae90","Marketplace","Marketplace AM","Marketplace AM for August 7, 2006","PMP:Marketplace_PMP"],"published":"2006-08-07T15:00:00+00:00","title":"iPod gizmos","byline":"Marketplace","description":"There are rumors — just rumors — that Apple CEO Steve Jobs may announce a new iPod later today.
