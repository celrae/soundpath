Six months later another 25, and in about two years, I had 200 sows farrowing continuously.</p>\n<p>But things were not going smoothly any longer! In one month, the farm hand quit and one of the kiln workers also quit. Taking care of the pigs myself required much of my time, and I was doing more of the physical labor at the kilns.

The $8 profit per pig had shrunk to $4.50 because of health issues with the pigs and difficulties in handling the increased numbers. Our litters had dropped from a nine pig-per-sow average to a seven-pig average. The charcoal kilns were hurting too, as we were trying to produce 200 tons of raw charcoal per month, but the average had dropped to 170 tons.</p>\n<p>This was not good!
