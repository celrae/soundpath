On Saturday, Jan.  10, the team sets out for round two, with an expedition that will take them from Central Florida to the Gulf Coast through the Big Bend and across the Panhandle to the Alabama state line. We talk to bear biologist Joe Guthrie, conservationist Mallory Lykes Dimmitt and photojournalist Carlton Ward, Jr.  about what they're hoping to accomplish on this 925-mile journey.  Team members will document their journey on FloridaWildlifeCorridor.org, and WUSF reporters will be checking in with them weekly as they make their way across Florida.","itags":["npr_api","375500216"],"contentencoded":"<p><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 MPX.
