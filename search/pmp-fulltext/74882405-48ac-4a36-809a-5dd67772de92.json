The economy was booming.&nbsp; Upward mobility seemed really possible.&nbsp; So much so that the worlds of salary man and wage earner began to merge.<br />\n<br />\nIn July of 1959, there was a sort of official declaration of this fact by the United States government, when the Department of Labor released a report titled “How American Buying Habits Change.”<br />\n<br />\n“Today the wage earner's way of life is well nigh indistinguishable from that of his salaried co-citizens,” the report announced.&nbsp; “Their homes, their cars, their baby sitters, the&nbsp; style of the clothes their wives and children wear, the food they eat, the bank or lending institution where they establish credit, their days off, the education of their children, their church -- all of these are alike and are becoming more nearly identical.”<br />\n<br />\nOr, as Kathleen Newman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies mass media and society, paraphrases: “Guess what, we did it, everyone's middle class.&nbsp; We can relax now.”<br />\n<br />\nAnd Hollywood began to reflect that storyline back to us.&nbsp; We stopped seeing many Marty the Butchers.&nbsp; We got lots of men in suits, from Ward Cleaver in \"Leave it to Beaver\" all the way through Dr. Huxtable in \"The Cosby Show\" (who may have been famous for his colorful sweaters, but whose job as a doctor and&nbsp; well-appointed home put him squarely in the white-collar middle class.)<br />\n<br />\nFor a while at least, Hollywood's airbrushed version of the middle class made some sense. Wages for average workers <em>were</em> rising. A blue collar job <em>could</em> afford you a lot of the stuff a white collar family had. But by the late 1970s that trend was in reverse. Since then, the gap between the two ends of the middle class has only continued to widen. And Hollywood has been less quick to chart that new direction.<br />\n<br />\nThis disconnect was made painfully clear to a set decorator named Rosemary Brandenburg several years ago, when she was working on the set for \"Castaway.\" Before Tom Hanks gets in that plane crash and has to survive on a desert island, there's a scene at his girlfriend's parents house, eating Christmas dinner.<br />\n<br />\n“We were asked to make a ‘typical middle class’ dining room/ living room,” Brandenburg remembers. “And I was too shy to&nbsp; go to our director and ask him <em>which</em> middle class he really wanted.”<br />\n<br />\nThat’s when Brandenburg made her mistake.<br />\n<br />\n“I made middle class in my life, which was old fashioned granny lamp shade, print couches and a La-Z-Boy chair, printed wall paper.” In short, a <em>working class</em> version of a \"typical middle class home” -- well loved, a little bit shabby.<br />\n<br />\nWhen Rosemary had the set ready, the director came to see. “He walked in and just hated it. Said ‘What have you done here?&nbsp; I mean this looks like grandma's house!’ He had in mind someone with much more upscale tastes, and up-to-date furnishings.<br />\n<br />\nBrandenburg complied with the director’s version of the middle class. She redid the set, lampshade to wallpaper. Here’s a clip -- it’s a little dark, but if you look closely you’ll notice the fancier props.<br />\n<br />\n<center>\n<div></div>\n<p></p>\n<p><script language=\"JavaScript\" type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js\">\n</script></p>\n<p><object id=\"myExperience2515996435001\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\" />\n<param name=\"width\" value=\"480\" />\n<param name=\"height\" value=\"270\" />\n<param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1365020870001\" />\n<param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAABPZFZ5wk~,VY0U0Oj-SxAV5JBPQ4IWgV4iIwZfikFU\" />\n<param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\" />\n<param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"2515996435001\" /></object></p>\n<p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n//<![CDATA[\nbrightcove.createExperiences();\n//]]>\n</script></p>\n<p></p>\n</center>\n<br />\nAfter the \"Castaway\" experience, Brandenburg says she never worked for that director again. But she says she also learned an important lesson. “One can't assume that middle class is middle class,” she says. Especially in Hollywood.<br />\n<br />\nHollywood's inflated version of the middle class is still alive and well. Think about the TV show \"New Girl,\" where a bunch of 20-somethings on teacher, bartender, research assistant and “junior lead marketing associate” salaries, live in a gorgeous loft in L.A.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.setdecorators.org/incEngine/sites/setdecorators/images/images/NG_1_loft.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://www.setdecorators.org/incEngine/sites/setdecorators/images/images/NG_1_loft.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />\nThen there’s that movie from a couple years ago, \"It's Complicated,\" where Meryl Streep plays a baker who somehow lives in a House Beautiful-worthy home -- literally, it was featured in the magazine -- in Santa Barbara, where the kitchen alone looks like it cost a fortune. Oh yeah, and the plot of the movie centers around a remodel of said kitchen, so Streep’s character can finally get a “real” one.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.housebeautiful.com/cm/housebeautiful/images/d9/hbx-its-complicated-kitchens-de.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://www.housebeautiful.com/cm/housebeautiful/images/d9/hbx-its-complicated-kitchens-de.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><br />\nOf course there’s nothing wrong with dreaming.&nbsp; And Hollywood never pretended to be anything but pretend.&nbsp; But consider this observation, from Damon Silvers, a labor lawyer for the AFL-CIO. When he watches this stuff, he thinks about how it shapes the collective image we have of ourselves.<br />\n<br />\n“There is a tendency to imagine that we live in a country where the typical family makes $150,000 a year. But half of all American households have incomes less than $55,000 a year,” he says. “So there's a kind of a cognitive problem here. We don't live in the country we think we live in. The world that is projected as middle class in the media is a world that no more than something like 15 percent of America can afford.”<br />\n<br />\nAnd yet, a lot of us try to afford it. Often by getting in lots of debt.<br />\n<br />\n<h2>Listen to Krissy's interview with Marketplace Money</h2>\n<br />\n<iframe title=\"marketplace_segments_2013_07_12_marketplace_segment27_20130712_64s_player\" type=\"text/html\" src=\"http://minnesota.publicradio.org/www_publicradio/tools/media_player/syndicate.php?name=marketplace/segments/2013/07/12/marketplace_segment27_20130712_64\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>","itags":["PMP:Marketplace_PMP","Marketplace for Friday, June 28, 2013","Marketplace Money for Friday, July 12, 2013","Marketplace Money","Marketplace","7488240548aca36909a95dd67772de92"],"byline":"Karen Clark","contenttemplated":"[{\"content\":\"<p>Consumer spending drives most of the growth in the American economy.  And that spending depends on having enough people with enough disposable income that they&apos;re willing and able to spend.
