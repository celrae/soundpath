Spectators have been killed by getting hit by bikes. Riders themselves can have their careers ruined, they can be taken out. It&#8217;s sort of a funny phenomenon and I am sort of enjoying it, to be honest. But there is a really serious aspect to this that someone&#8217;s really going to get hurt.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On what separates this year&#8217;s race from other years</strong></p><p>&#8220;The past few years the tours tended to be just a test of fitness. The guys could look down at the computers on their handlebars and see how many watts they were putting out and just, sort of, carefully judge how hard they needed to go. This course is more of a racer&#8217;s course. It&#8217;s going to reward some risk taking and some savvy strategy.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://truebs.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Bill Strickland</strong></a>, interim editor <a href=\"http://www.bicycling.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycling</a> magazine and author of &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tour-Lance-Extraordinary-Cyclings-Controversial/dp/0307589951/?tag=wburorg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de Lance: The Extraordinary Story of Cycling&#8217;s Most Controversial Champion</a>.&#8221; He tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TrueBS\" target=\"_blank\">@TrueBS</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
