It also strips them of extra job safeguards not enjoyed by other school or state employees. And it eliminates the current tenure process, under which instructors are either fired or win strong job security about 18 months after they start teaching.&#8221;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
