In addition, a certain subset of our applicant pool want to go to the farthest, most remote, most difficult post. There are people who are just driven by that type of service.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the recent decline in applicants</strong></p><p>&#8220;Our applicants have lots of choices now. In the early days when Peace Corps began, it was really the only opportunity for people who wanted to live or work overseas. But now there are many choices for people to be overseas.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On 76 percent of Peace Corps volunteers being white</strong></p><p>&#8220;We can do a better job in recruiting in places we&#8217;ve never recruited before. That&#8217;s why a major part of our new recruitment effort is reaching out to diverse communities in ways we haven&#8217;t before. We&#8217;ve hired over 20 recruiters who are really focused on recruiting diverse populations. We also are creating partnerships with networks that service some of our underrepresented groups.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the value of the Peace Corps in 2014</strong></p><p><div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"\">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone who is more globally competent than a Peace Corps volunteer.&#8221;</div></p><p>&#8220;In this increasingly complex and interconnected world, I think our country needs to have Americans who can speak other languages, understand other cultures and find commonality with our own. I think the future of our nation depends on it and our position in the world. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone who is more globally competent than a Peace Corps volunteer who has lived for two years in another country, is fluent in at least one other language and really is able to see the world through another&#8217;s eyes.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.peacecorps.gov/about/leadership/dir/\" target=\"_blank\">Carrie Hessler-Radelet</a></strong>, director of the <a href=\"http://www.peacecorps.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Peace Corps</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 WBUR-FM.
