A rumor persists that Blackwater, whose own reputation problems have led it to change its name multiple times, has merged with Monsanto.

Peter Shumlin signed a bill into law that made Vermont the first state to require labeling of genetically modified foods. There was music, people were smiling, and Ben & Jerry&#8217;s CEO Jostein Solheim handed out free ice cream to the crowd of about 300 people. Ben & Jerry&#8217;s is in the process of going completely GMO-free.&#8221;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
