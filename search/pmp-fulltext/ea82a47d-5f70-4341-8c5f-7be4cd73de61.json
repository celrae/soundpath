Now they are together again. <br /> <br /><em>The Equalizer</em> is unapologetic in its excessive, frequently grotesque violence. But because it's got Denzel Washington as its star, it's more interested in character development than you might guess.</p><p>The movie takes a full half hour introducing Robert, Washington's character, as a seemingly ordinary Boston resident who has a nine-to-five job and never misses a chance to pass on a wide range of positive-thinking aphorisms.</p><p>\"I think you can be anything you want to be,\" he says.</p><p>Robert is talking to a young Russian prostitute, played by Chloe Grace Moretz. He takes a fatherly interest in her and that turns him into the world's deadliest Boy Scout, able to create the kind of mayhem with a corkscrew that no sommelier would ever condone.</p><p>Robert's heroics bring to Boston a fierce Russian enforcer known as a sociopath with a business card. Does Robert back down? No he does not.</p><p>\"I've done some bad things in my life,\" he says. \"I promised someone that I love very much that I would never go back to being that person, but for you I'm going to make an exception.\"</p><p><em>The Equalizer</em> echoes Clint Eastwood's brilliant <em>Unforgiven</em> by focusing on how strong and irresistible the lure of violence is for those who have indulged in it.</p><p>Now that Robert is off the wagon, it will come as no surprise that an <em>Equalizer 2</em> is in the works.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
