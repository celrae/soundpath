When we found out, we were just sitting down to record <em>Alt.Latino</em>. We decided that, rather than putting together a last-minute tribute, we should give this music legend the proper farewell he deserved. So we invited listeners and friends to share their most important Cerati moments with us.</p><p>The musicians we play on this show all owe some sort of debt to Cerati: In the '80s, with his band Soda Stereo, he helped create the Latin American rock legend. Rock music had been heard in parts of the continent, but the idea of a band touring the land and attracting tens of thousands of fans was unheard of. Soda Stereo ushered in the golden era of Spanish-language rock.</p><p>In the late '90s, Soda Stereo broke up, and Cerati embarked on a fruitful and creative solo career that continued to push boundaries and blow us away.</p><p>Join me and my friend Ernesto Lechner, co-host of a fantastic show called <a href=\"http://thelatinalternative.com/\">The Latin Alternative</a>, as we reminisce about growing up in Argentina during the golden years of Soda Stereo, the band's best work, and the genius of Gustavo Cerati.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
