What I did at that time was I went to the public library, and I would go to the children’s book section where there would be alphabet books and everything would be illustrated. So it was very easy to connect the words to the images. I said, ‘I’m just going to do the same thing. If I did it once before, I can do it again.’”</p><p>For Santiago, reading &#8220;War and Peace&#8221; by Leo Tolstoy was an accomplishment after recovering from her stroke.</p><p>&#8220;I read the war scenes, the stuff people skip over, because for me it was proof that I actually had recovered from the stroke, that I could read every word in that book,” Santiago said.</p><ul><li><strong>Neurology Now</strong>: <a href=\"http://patients.aan.com/resources/neurologynow/?event=home.showArticle&id=ovid.com://bib/ovftdb/01222928-201410040-00014\">Hitting The Books</a></li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.esmeraldasantiago.com/\"><strong>Esmeralda Santiago</strong></a>, author of &#8220;When I Was Puerto Rican,&#8221; &#8220;Almost A Woman,&#8221; and &#8220;Conquistadora.&#8221; She tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Esmo\">@Esmo</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
