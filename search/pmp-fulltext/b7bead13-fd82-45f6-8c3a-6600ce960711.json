The food and beverage industry loves us as adults to think that the kids won&#8217;t eat it. There are numerous studies on this that say a child has to be exposed to a certain type of food ten to twenty times before they&#8217;ll eat it. That means that we have to keep trying. We really need to remember there are no cases in recorded history of a child starving to death when there&#8217;s a plate of healthy food sitting in front of them.</p><p><strong>Tips Adamick has given to schools to save money</strong></p><p>&#8220;[A district was] portioning salad and food and everything in little plastic cups. When you do that, you&#8217;re paying for those little plastic cups &#8230; If you put it out for kids to take on their tray, that&#8217;s faster, that&#8217;s much less labor intensive and you save all of that money, both on the labor time and the plastic cups.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;The federal government funds school food both with cash and with an allotment of food. You can order it either raw &#8212; so I can order raw chicken, or I can send that raw chicken to a processor and have them turn it into chicken nuggets, and chicken fingers, and chicken dinosaurs, which are typically laden with salt, fat and sugar &#8230; You pay for that. So take the free chicken in and cook the chicken.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://cookforamerica.com/bios/#kate\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Kate Adamick</strong></a>, co-founder of <a href=\"http://cookforamerica.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cook for America</a> and author of &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lunch-Money-Serving-Healthy-Economy/dp/0984872213\" target=\"_blank\">Lunch Money: Serving Healthy Food in a Sick Economy</a>.&#8221; She tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CookForAmerica\" target=\"_blank\">@CookForAmerica</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
