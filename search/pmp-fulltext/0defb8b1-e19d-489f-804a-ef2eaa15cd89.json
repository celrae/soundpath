In fact, much hay was made over a recent report by the Federal Reserve. It said that Americans cut more than $90 billion from their credit card debt from 2008 to 2009. Well, Odysseas Papadimitriou had more than a few questions about that. He's the CEO of CardHub.com, a credit card comparison Web site.<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong class=\"name\">Odysseas Papadimitriou:</strong> Number one was obviously the record unemployment rates and where did people with no incomes find the money.
