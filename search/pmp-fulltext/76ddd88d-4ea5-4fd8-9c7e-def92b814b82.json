These are the moments when everything seems to click, and people leap forward into their careers</em><em>.</em></p><p>Tom Toro didn't always dream of becoming a cartoonist at <em>The New Yorker</em>. Sure, he drew cartoons in college, but he didn't see that as a career path. Instead, he went to film school at NYU.</p><p>Then he came to the sudden realization that he was in the wrong field — and he had no idea what he was going to do.</p><p>\"Up to my neck in debt, directionless, feeling lost in the huge city,\" Tom Toro says. \"I went into a pretty dark depression. I ended up dropping out of film school. I floundered around for a little while, and I finally just had to come back home.\"</p><p>He says moving back in with his parents was an adjustment. He remembers the long, quiet dinners sitting around the table trying to make conversation.</p><p>\"I had sort of been a golden child,\" he says. \"I was valedictorian in my high school class, I went to Yale, I got into NYU right out of undergrad, and all of a sudden, I'm back at home. And I don't think my parents really understood what I was doing there. And I almost didn't understand myself.\"</p><p>One afternoon, Toro went to a used book sale in his hometown. He opened a cardboard box and found an old stack of magazines.</p><p>\"For some reason, I was drawn toward them and I started riffling through them,\" he says.</p><p>They were stacks of old <em>New Yorkers</em>.</p><p>\"There they were, these cartoons in among the articles,\" he says. \"I don't know. Something just clicked. And I started drawing again.\"</p><p>Toro decided to submit some of his work to the magazine. But he had no idea how.</p><p>\"So I just sent them to <em>The New Yorker</em> by post,\" he says. \"I would walk from my parents' house down to the post office and mail off these packets of cartoons that I was sketching together every week.\"</p><p>Shortly after, he received a reply in the mail: It was his first rejection note.</p><p>\"It's like two of the most elegantly phrased sentences,\" he says. \"<em>The New Yorker</em> found the way to most courteously and most briefly reject people. It's just beautiful. You feel so honored to receive it and yet it's a brushoff.\"</p><p>A year and a half later, Toro had a pile of rejection letters. But instead of feeling discouraged, he says, it only fueled his determination.</p><p>He traveled across the country just to introduce himself to Bob Mankoff, the cartoon editor at <em>The New Yorker</em>.</p><p>\"I went in, he looked at my stuff — I was just nervously sitting there waiting for him to say something,\" Toro says. \"And I remember he looked up and said, 'I don't see any joy in these. These aren't ready yet.' \"</p><p>Toro says that's the comment that stuck with him.</p><p>\"So I went back home and I just threw everything that I had done previously out the door, sat down with a blank sheet of paper, and just tried to draw from the heart,\" he says.</p><p>Toro was still receiving rejection letters in the mail, but he says his cartoons were getting better. Toro was finding his style.</p><p>And then, one day, he wandered into his mom's office to check his email.</p><p>\"Went in there, logged in, and there sitting at the top of my inbox was an email from [Bob Mankoff's] assistant,\" Toro says.</p><p>The subject line read, \"Cartoon Sold.\"</p><p>It was the 610th drawing Toro had submitted to <em>The New Yorker</em>.</p><p>\"That was the lucky number, you know?\" he says. \"If at first you don't succeed, try and try and try and try and try and try and try again.\"</p><p><em>We want to hear your big break.
