In some notable ways, though, the giving patterns of the well-off differ from the giving patterns of the rest of us.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>“In the past, what we’ve seen is that high-net-worth donors give disproportionately, when you compare them to the average American household, to arts and culture institutions, ranging from museums, music, performance organizations and so forth,” Osili said.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Gifts to elite universities, fine arts museums and symphonies, spur one group of critics to argue that wealthy Americans donate to causes that benefit or appeal mostly to other wealthy Americans.

F.

That is the amount of money refunded under the charitable tax deduction. Dalzell says if our democratic government is supposed to represent we, the people, then offering tax breaks for donations to things that most Americans don’t have a stake in, is, at it’s heart, undemocratic.</span>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>“Fifty billion dollars,” said Dalzell, “while it may seem like a drop in the bucket, is not really a drop in the bucket if you think hard about what you might do with it otherwise.”</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The charitable tax deduction remains a lightening rod for criticism, in part, because a donor gets a tax break whether the money is going to a well-funded symphony orchestra or to children who survived the devastation of typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. This bothers a second group of critics who argue there ought to be a hierarchy of giving, because, they say, some causes are simply more worthy than others.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“I think there’s something wrong with people not focusing their philanthropy on where it is going to do the most good,” said <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~psinger/\">Peter Singer</a>, a professor of bioethics at <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/main/\">Princeton University</a> (on the Million Dollar List 144 times) and author of “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-You-Can-Save/dp/0812981561\">The Life You Can Save: Acting Now to End World Poverty</a>.” “I think that giving to art museums and operas and galleries and so on, in the world as it is today, is not doing the most good. I think that there are better things they could be doing with money that they’re giving away.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Singer’s most effective arguments are simple games of choice, which are peppered throughout his book.

When I tell him I am planning a trip to the <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York, which is on the Million Dollar List 81 times, Singer mentions that, around ten years ago, the Met paid $45 million dollars for a small painting by the Sienese artist, <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/438754\">Duccio di Buoninsegna</a>.

Thousands of them. And when they came in, they looked around, they went to the galleries, they went to their favorite work of art.
