Then we give ourselves a quiz and discuss What's Making Us Happy.","itags":["npr_api","347670504"],"guid":"eabdffcc-ba67-4f55-aa9c-c07248b097da","contentencoded":"<p>With the ever-intrepid Linda Holmes attending the Toronto International Film Festival — more on that next week — Glen Weldon and I get to welcome our <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/\">Code Switch</a> pals Kat Chow and Gene Demby to this week's show.</p><p>As you might imagine, we open with a few words about Joan Rivers, who died Sept. 4, and along the way encourage folks at home to read Rivers tributes by Julie Klausner (<a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/what-it-was-like-to-work-with-joan-rivers.html\">in Vulture</a>) and Caissie St. Onge (<a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/entertainment/joan-rivers-memorial\">in xoJane</a>). Then, we delve into a thorny, Rivers-inspired topic: the celebrity apology. Along the way, we examine how an assortment of famous folks — including Ricky Gervais, Henry Rollins, Cee-Lo Green, Ray Rice, Justin Bieber, and even Rivers herself — have dealt with public outcry over their recent statements and behavior. This, as you can imagine, sends us off on tangents about sincerity, authenticity, free speech, and the many ways a poorly worded apology can exacerbate PR problems it was meant to defuse. (During the segment, I recommend Linda's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2012/06/01/154135898/john-edwards-once-more-with-or-without-feeling-he-takes-full-responsibility\">piece on John Edwards</a>, as well as Lindy West's recent <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/ricky-gervais-broke-my-heart-1630075731\">piece on Gervais</a> for Jezebel.)</p><p>From there, we revisit an old standby: the Regrettable Television Pop Quiz, in which the gang proves shockingly knowledgeable about bad TV in the past and present. (Tragically, like a Pip with no Gladys Knight, I'm forced to warble the theme song all by myself.) <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108693/\">Gene's pick</a> is timely, in light of <a href=\"http://abc.go.com/shows/fresh-off-the-boat\">a show</a> on this fall's schedule. <a href=\"http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/girlfriend-intervention\">My pick</a> is timely, in light of the way it makes Gene cover his face with his hands for the better part of a minute. <a href=\"http://www.tv.com/shows/are-you-hot/\">Kat's pick</a> triggers memories Glen and I both wish we'd purged entirely. And <a href=\"http://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/sex-sent-me-to-the-er\">Glen's pick</a>... gosh. Yeah, Glen's pick.</p><p>We close, as always, with a spirited round of what's making us happy. Kat loves <a href=\"http://thenerdsofcolor.org/\">this blog</a>. Gene loves <a href=\"https://www.xkcd.com/\"><em>this</em> blog/comic</a>, and <a href=\"https://whatif.xkcd.com/book/\">this book</a> it spun off. Glen tiptoes up to the Zaxxon rule in his discussion of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/shopping/product/13261491447769366996?biw=1128&bih=859&sclient=psy-ab&q=technogym+cardio+wave+700e&oq=technogym+cardio+wave+700e&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm=bv.74894050,d.aWw,pv.xjs.s.en_US.du00fpua6hE.O&tch=1&ech=1&psi=rsMRVM73LI6pyAS1woCQDw.1410450351008.3&sa=X&ei=7MMRVOOXDMOhyAT0qYHoBQ&ved=0CIQBELkk\">this piece of exercise equipment</a>.
