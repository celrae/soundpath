And time travel and/or eternal life! We talk quite a bit about coverage of the film at The Dissolve, so <a href=\"http://thedissolve.com/reviews/841-edge-of-tomorrow/\" target=\"_blank\">read it all</a>.</p><p>Then, we take a listener suggestion and consider the noble flop. The first question, of course, is what we mean by \"noble\" and what we mean by \"flop\" (or, alternately, \"failure\"). Chris brings to the table his enormous affection for the much-denounced <em>Hudson Hawk</em>, we wonder whether \"noble\" means more than Sting's good intentions, and how it feels to really dislike things while bearing no ill will whatsoever toward the people who tried in vain to make them good.</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about the avalanche of great things that are around right now in general, including an unexpected <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/cartoonist-bill-watterson-returns-for-pearls.html\" target=\"_blank\">return</a>.

Chris is happy about <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/miracleman-marvelman-alan-moore-comics-dream-of-flying.html\" target=\"_blank\">another unexpected return</a>, so apparently it's the week for that.
