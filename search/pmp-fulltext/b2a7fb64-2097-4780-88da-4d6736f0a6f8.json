These are the moments when everything seems to click, and people leap forward into their careers.</em></p><p>Guitarist Dean Dillon is best known for writing hit songs for country artists like <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111617326\">George Strait</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/10/13/130536256/toby-keith-wins-record-breaking-in-a-bad-way-week-on-the-charts\">Toby Keith</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/130105729/kenny-chesney\">Kenny Chesney</a>.</p><p>Before being inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, Dillon grew up in the little town of Lake City in East Tennessee. That's where he got his first guitar.</p><p>\"A tiger-striped Stella,\" Dillon says. \"Orange and black. I proceeded to sleep with it on a nightly basis. It became my best friend, and it became my voice.\"</p><p>When he was a teenager, Dillon entered a contest at the Tennessee Valley Fair in Knoxville. He brought his guitar on stage.</p><p>\"It came down to me and a flaming-baton twirler,\" he says. \"And she dropped her baton, and I won the contest.\"</p><p>First prize was a guest appearance on the local TV show <em>Jim Clayton's Startime</em>. Host and mobile-home salesman Jim Clayton used a stage on his lot to showcase local music and sell his trailer homes.</p><p>\"We would play in the mobile-home lots in venues around East Tennessee,\" Dillon says. \"I cut my teeth on it.\"</p><p>The young songwriter had his sights set on Nashville. Right after graduating high school in 1973, Dillon grabbed his guitar, stuffed his clothes in a duffel bag and hit the interstate, hitchhiking to the city.</p><p>\"Eighteen years old, 130 pounds soaking wet, scared to death,\" Dillon says. \"I didn't know a soul. I didn't know where Music Row was, but I found out soon enough.\"</p><p>He made his way to Opryland, where he would sit backstage between shows at a picnic table. Dillon says that's where he wrote his songs.</p><p>He was approached by hit songwriter John Schweers who told him on the spot, \"Play me something.\"</p><p>After listening to Dillon's songs, Schweers set up a meeting with Nashville producer and publisher Tom Collins.</p><p>\"Walked in his office, shook and [said] howdy and sat down in front of his desk,\" Dillon says.</p><p>Collins asked him to play a couple of songs. Dillon took out his guitar and began playing.</p><p>\"He opened his desk drawer and pulled a three-page contract and said, 'I want to sign you to a publishing deal.'</p><p>\"That's how it all got started,\" Dillon says. \"All from just strumming backstage.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
