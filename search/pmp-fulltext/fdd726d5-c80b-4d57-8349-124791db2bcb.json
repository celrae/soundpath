Whatever you see yourself doing in retirement. Fishing, or time with your grandkids, or just relaxing -- reality is it takes money and a dedicated financial plan. Liz Weston, personal finance columnist and author, joins us to answer your questions about retirement funds -- how to save, what accounts to use, and how to think about planning.

So they're trying to make up for lost ground, trying to pay off for that debt. They don't realize that retirement has to be their top priority, that you can't put it off. The other thing that's going on is that wonderful human optimism we have that somehow something is going to come along and save us. What I'm worried about is these people are going to hit retirement and they're facing what's called a cliff retirement, which means their lifestyle is going to fall off a cliff. By that time it's too late. By the time you get into your 50s and 60s it's going to be really hard to catch up -- if you even can,\" says Weston.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/your-money/guide-us-retirement-accounts\"><img src=\"http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/retirement-arrow.jpg?itok=8W9KNPm9\" alt=\"\" /></a><strong><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/your-money/guide-us-retirement-accounts\">A guide to U.S. retirement accounts</a></strong> Learn more about what kind of plans are out there and which is best for you.

Unfortunately, though, the message is not getting through.</p>\n<p>\"We've got to get those people in their 20s. Come on guys, get that 401(k) started. There's a free match most of the time. You're getting a tax break. Just do it. Yes, you have other priorities, but you've got to make retirement first,\" says Weston.</p>\n<p>For young people wondering whether they should pay off student debt first or start a retirement account, Weston says you should start the account.</p>\n<p>\"The fact is there is no better time to start saving for retirement than in your 20s. You have decades ahead of you for that money to grow. If it's not in there, earning those compounded returns, you're not going to get to the place where you can have some choices with retirement. That's the thing, people think they can catch up later. It becomes increasingly difficult. If you could start saving maybe 10 percent in your 20s for retirement, by your 30s you might have to save 15 or 20 percent, by your 40s you might have to save 20-25 percent. Once you're in your 50s you'd have to save 40 percent of your income to match what you would have gotten if you'd saved just 10 percent starting in your 20s.\"</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/Retirement-Tips-Infographic.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Weston also answered the following questions from callers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Diana, 49, from Colorado has $35,000 saved in retirement.
