The main fuel behind it is the difference in temperature between the Arctic and the warmer regions to the south.<a href=\"http://climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/us-temperature-extremes-and-polar-jet-stream\"><div class=\"media media-element-container media-image_on_right\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/200mb_geopotentialheight_anomnov2103-jul2014_610.jpg?itok=kMZNiesl\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>The polar jet stream has repeatedly followed a path of steep ridges and toughs over North America, as illustrated here for the period of November 2013-July 2014.

And Francis herself cautions that the climate system is extremely complicated, and that a lot of other big changes are in play at the same time as the disrupted jet stream. “We can't draw a straight line between what's happening in the Arctic and what's happening to us in the east” and elsewhere around the world, she says. But, she adds, “what we do think is happening is the Arctic warming so fast is making it more likely that these kinds of patterns will happen more often.”</div>\n<p>That may give Bostonians pause. Everyone here is talking about how nasty the winter has been, but the mostly-unspoken assumption is that since it’s almost never happened before, it probably won’t happen again in our lifetimes.</p>\n<p>But Francis says that’s “not a safe assumption at all” given the recent changes in the jet stream. She also points out that <a href=\"http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-02-11/big-snow-warming-world-whats\">the Atlantic Ocean off the east coast has been warming</a>, creating more evaporation. “[That] puts more moisture in the air, [and] that moisture is also fuel for storms,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Or, she suggests, things could go the other way: a shift in those big dips could push the cold part of the loop elsewhere and bring more Northeast winters like 2012 when, among other things, there were already crocuses and mosquitoes in Boston by early March.</p>\n<p>So get ready — and keep your long underwear <em>and</em> your shorts handy.</p>\n<p><em>This story has been updated to reflect contrasting theories on this particular climate debate.</em></p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-02-23%2Fwarming-arctic-putting-new-england-deep-freeze&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/Jet%20stream.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/jet-streamjpg"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0223201509.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0223201509mp3"}]}
