I sympathize for the victims, what can I tell you, and I&#8217;m afraid for the rest of us. The same thing with the Charlie Hebdo here in Paris, it is just terrifying what Islam is encouraging people to do. You can say radical Islam if you want, but I can tell you that as a prisoner in a jail, they certainty use textual license in the Quran to kill the non-believers, and that is what they are doing.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think I would come back. I really was persuaded that the things I was seeing I would never be able to tell to anybody.&#8221;</p><p></div></p><p><strong>On radical Islam</strong></p><p>&#8220;Our question really about this kind of Islam is how do young men find themselves seduced into it&#8230;what is the beauty of it because nobody could be attracted to a murderous ideology simply because its murder. One does not grow up wishing to be a killer. Reciting the Quran is a beautiful exercise perhaps especially when your friends and neighbors are being killed. The Quran has so much meaning to convey to people who are under that kind of stress.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On being held captive</strong></p><p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think I would come back. I really was persuaded that the things I was seeing I would never be able to tell to anybody, but they let me go, so I am in a position now to share what I learned. Some of it is known, but a lot of it isn&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221;</p><p><strong>On U.S.-Syria relations</strong></p><p>&#8220;I think what needs to happen is we need to partner with the Assad regime. I think we need to encourage them to conduct themselves in a more civilized way. They have been dealing with this for decades, they have all the connections. To dismantle the Assad regime would put the entire religious group of the President in mortal jeopardy, risking a genocide&#8230;These people have committed war crimes and yet they are our best hope I believe for putting this castellated country back together again.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Theo Padnos</strong>, author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Undercover-Muslim-Journey-into-Yemen/dp/1847920845\" target=\"_blank\">Undercover Muslim: A Journey Into Yemen</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/magazine/theo-padnos-american-journalist-on-being-kidnapped-tortured-and-released-in-syria.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">My Captivity: Theo Padnos, American Journalist, on Being Kidnapped, Tortured and Released in Syria</a>.
