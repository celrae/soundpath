The blog featured the writing of veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Roy served in the U.S. Army in Iraq in 2003 and 2004. &#8220;Home Fires&#8221; introduced me to him, and other writers and veterans, such as <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/tag/brian-turner\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Turner</a> and <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/tag/andrew-slater\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Slater</a>, whoÂ we have featured on <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now</a></em> over the years. Today it&#8217;s Roy&#8217;s turn.</p><p>He came home from the war in Iraq and started writing fiction, poetry and essays. He co-edited the collection of short stories called &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Forget-Short-Stories-Long/dp/0306821761/?tag=wburorg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Fire and Forget: Short Stories from the Long War</a>.&#8221; His most recent writing is a story called &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/back-to-baghdad-life-in-the-city-of-doom-20140717\" target=\"_blank\">Back to Baghdad</a>,&#8221; which is in Rolling Stone. It&#8217;s the subject of his conversation with Jeremy Hobson on <em>Here & Now</em>.</p><p>Roy went back to Baghdad in April of this year and didn&#8217;t find a pretty picture. It was a time of car bombs and the beginning stages of the advance by ISIS, the Sunni-led militant group we now know as the Islamic State.</p><p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened over the last year has been the disintegration of the state that we left behind, and it shows the evidence of the truth of what we&#8217;d actually done,&#8221; he told Jeremy.</p><p><div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"\">&#8220;What&#8217;s happened over the last year has been the disintegration of the state that we left behind.&#8221;<div class=\"pullquoteauth\">&ndash; Roy Scranton</div></div></p><p>On Monday, police said they had found the bullet-ridden bodies of more than a dozen people in different areas of the capital city. That was a grim reminder of the sectarian bloodshed that engulfed the country in 2006 and 2007. And also a reminder that, as Roy Scranton says, the U.S. should still be paying attention to what is happening in Iraq.</p><p>&#8220;When we left, we didn&#8217;t just erase it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When we left Iraq, we remained connected to it.&#8221;</p><p>Veterans like Roy Scranton certainly are still connected to it, and through the writing he and other vets are doing, we are too. I sent an email to Peter Catapano the other day. Peter&#8217;s an editor with The New York Times&#8217; opinion section and he created and edited the &#8220;Home Fire&#8221; blog. I just wanted to thank him for doing that and for introducing me to the writing of these veterans.</p><p>&#8220;Working with this group of writers has been the high point for me as an editor,&#8221; Peter responded, &#8220;something I am most proud of, based strictly on the quality and importance of that work.&#8221;</p><p>That work continues.</p><p>Brian Turner&#8217;s memoir &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.brianturner.org/\" target=\"_blank\">My Life as a Foreign Country</a>&#8221; will be published in the fall. You can read Andrew Slater&#8217;s work <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/andrew-slater.html\" target=\"_blank\">in the Daily Beast</a> and if you pick up Rolling Stone, the issue with Lana Del Ray on the cover, you can find Roy Scranton&#8217;s story about returning the country he fought in.</p><p>I hope they all keep writing.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.royscranton.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Roy Scranton</a></strong>, journalist and Army veteran of the Iraq War.
