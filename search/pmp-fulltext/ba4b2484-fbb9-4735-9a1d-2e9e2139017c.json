The 85-year-old New Yorker is a veteran salmon slicer at Zabar's, the gourmet food shop in Manhattan.</p><p>But it wasn't always that way. For nearly four decades, Berk was an accountant.</p><p>\"I never loved it, but accounting provided a decent living,\" he said to his friend Joshua Gubitz, during a recent visit to StoryCorps. \"And it was very important for me to take care of my children. So after I retired I looked for something to do next.\"</p><p>One day, Berk got a call from a friend who said that she saw an advertisement that a large gourmet food store was looking for a lox slicer, and he thought,\"I could do that.\"</p><p>\"I had been a customer of that store for many years and I used to buy chunks of salmon and take it home and slice them myself because I've always enjoyed slicing salmon,\" he said.</p><p>Berk says he didn't really have any lox-slicing credentials, but felt very comfortable with the salmon.</p><p>\"So I applied for the job. I sent the owner an email listing 10 credentials: uh, I've been one of your best customers; I'm reliable; I've always been a fish person.\"</p><p>The owner called him immediately asking, \"What kind of a CPA wants to slice lox?\"</p><p>Berk has been slicing ever since.</p><p>\"When I started one of the things that I loved was my ability to deal with the most difficult customers,\" he said. \"Customer would say, 'I don't like that slice.' I would say, 'Oh, I'll be happy to take that slice off, and not only that I'll give you a free slice.' \"</p><p>That was a long time ago, though.</p><p>\"Now I have a hard time controlling myself,\" Berk said. \"When I'm slicing, I'm slicing. Very often I get lost in the lox. Somebody will say, 'Do you hear what I'm saying?' And I would say, 'Yes I do, but I'm very involved in slicing your salmon now.'</p><p>\"I would say fish in general is in my blood, and now that I'm there for a while and I feel my oats, I want my slices to have more style, more character,\" he said. \"More panache.\"</p><p>Recently Berk's wife asked him how he wanted to spend the rest of his life.</p><p>His response? \"I want to spend the rest of my life doing exactly what I'm doing. I'm working toward the perfect slice. \"</p><p><em>Audio produced for </em>Morning Edition<em> by Liyna Anwar.</em></p><p><em>StoryCorps is a national nonprofit that gives people the chance to interview friends and loved ones about their lives.
