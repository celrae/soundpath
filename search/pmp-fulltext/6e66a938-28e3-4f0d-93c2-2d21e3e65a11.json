It was the broadcast television version of a stomping monster that took out small cities.</p><p>The original dream of propelling star after star into the heavens didn't pan out as producers might have hoped, but the show has its list of famous alums: winners Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood went on to be straight-up superstars, Phillip Phillips grabbed on to the popularity of Mumford-and-Sons-y Americana as it flew by and did well for himself, other finalists like Fantasia Barrino and Constantine Maroulis went to Broadway, and a lot of others have had perfectly good careers putting out records even if they haven't been as widely recognized as the grandest of champions. Clay Aiken even ran for Congress. (And Jennifer Hudson! Who won an Oscar! And whom I originally forgot because that's how much I no longer associate her with this show.)</p><p>It seemed at one time like <em>Idol </em>was a show that would ebb and flow but never die, like <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. But Fox has other plans and other priorities, there's competition from other performance shows and other competition shows, and, as it turns out, very few things are <em>Saturday Night Live</em>.</p><p>So now, Ryan Seacrest will be the man who only seems to have 99 jobs. We'll have much, much more about fall schedules as this week of TV news progresses.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
