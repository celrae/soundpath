I&#8217;m also known as Captain Luke. My voice get down so low it&#8217;ll untie your shoestrings. That’ll give you a problem tying them back up.&#8221;</p><p>Captain Luke is 86 years old, and I barely saw him without a cigarette in his mouth. He wears a captain&#8217;s hat, an accessory he picked up years ago working in a Winston-Salem drink house. A paisley tie is in a knot around his neck. For Captain Luke,the music started early.</p><p>&#8220;I’ve been singing since I was 14 years old out in the cotton field playing with my uncle, following him all day in the field playing,&#8221; Captain Luke says. &#8220;He blew the harmonica. And he sung. And I was right behind him barefoot as a yard dog.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjyJ7j8OwGM\">[Youtube]</a></p><p>On that farm, Luther’s uncle had a mule that worked along with them. His name was Buck.</p><p>&#8220;I just made up a song about him and King Bee,&#8221; Captain Luke says. &#8220;You’d see the little bees flying around the flowers and stuff. And I thought I could make a song out of clear blue like that.&#8221;</p><p>Captain Luke is part of a group called the Music Maker Relief Foundation, which celebrated an anniversary over the weekend. For 20 years, Music Maker has been helping musicians pay a heating bill, or a doctor’s bill. It’s also a record company, run by Tim Duffy, that gives the artists work.</p><p>&#8220;When I met Tim that was the best part of my life because I got to go somewhere,&#8221; Captain Luke says.</p><p>Captain Luke started his touring in his sixties: &#8220;Salisbury. Highpoint. Little places like that you know, then we started getting other gigs,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Atlanta, Georgia. Switzerland. France. German. Argentina. He started getting gigs for us. I was having fun then. I hadn’t been nowhere good.&#8221;</p><p>Music Maker founder Tim Duffy says the organization&#8217;s mission is both to preserve Southern music &#8211;much of which he says is not recorded &#8212; and financially help out many blues musicians, who live on between $4,000 and $7,000 a year.</p><p>&#8220;These types of archaic music forms are always on the edge and they’re not very celebrated, and it’s very much a social justice thing,&#8221; Duffy says . &#8220;We’re crossing lines of race and poverty and trying to reach out. So it’s in danger of not being heard, of not being captured.&#8221;</p><p>But today, it will be captured. Another man – with deep-set eyes and a dark moustache &#8212; sits down with Duffy and Captain Luke.</p><p>&#8220;My real name is James. You call me James Boo Hanks. Boo Hanks is a stage name.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-d60K_rJ_s\">[Youtube]</a></p><p>And where does Boo come from?</p><p>&#8220;I don’t know,&#8221; Boo says. &#8220;When I was a little boy, they said, &#8216;Boo come here and do that!&#8217; Don’t ask me, I don’t know.&#8221;</p><p>Boo started playing gigs when he was 79 years-old.</p><p>&#8220;I feel good when I’m playing,&#8221; Boo says. &#8220;When the audience enjoys it, when it looks like they’re enjoying it I feel good.&#8221;</p><p>Boo Hanks still lives on a farm just over the North Carolina line in Virginia. His father played guitar before Boo Hanks even knew what a guitar was. He says music was a gift to him, from God.</p><p>&#8220;He told me, &#8216;If I give you a talent and you don’t use it, I’ll take it away and give it to somebody else,&#8217;&#8221; Boo says.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
