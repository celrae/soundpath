These are the moments when everything seems to click, and people leap forward into their careers.</em></p><p>Before Michael Kenneth Williams played Chalky White on HBO's <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> and the infamous Baltimore stickup man Omar Little on <em>The Wire</em>, he was a dancer. He appeared in music videos starring artists like Madonna and George Michael.</p><p>Then, on his 25th birthday, everything changed.</p><p>\"There was a popping party going on in Queens,\" Williams says. \"I went outside to get some air, and I saw that two of my other friends were being surrounded by some dudes I didn't know.\"</p><p>Thinking his friends were about to get jumped, Williams told them it was time to go home.</p><p>That's when someone else approached Williams from behind.</p><p>\"The dude wiped his hand across his mouth and ... smacked me,\" he says. \"What he did was he spit a razor. He was positioning the razor in his mouth to get it between his middle finger and ring finger. And then he swiped me down my face.\"</p><p>That cut would leave a permanent scar.</p><p>\"We managed to escape with our lives, barely, that night,\" he says.</p><p>After the attack, Williams' career took a different turn. Directors didn't want him to just dance in videos â€” they wanted him to act out thug roles.</p><p>\"They were like, 'Mike, roll these dice in this video! Have this fight in this video!' I was like, 'All right!' \" Williams remembers.</p><p>He was making a name for himself.</p><p>Then Tupac Shakur and Mickey Rourke were filming a movie in New York called <em>Bullet. </em>The production office happened to have a Polaroid picture of Williams, and Tupac himself selected Williams for the role of his little brother.</p><p>\"I think he saw my pain, my struggle, my heart,\" Williams says. \"I was starstruck. I was like, 'Wow, this is Tupac Shakur.' \"</p><p>After filming <em>Bullet,</em><em> </em>Williams booked roles on <em>Law and Order</em> and <em>The Sopranos</em>.</p><p>\"I got a little high on the horse,\" he says. \" 'I ain't going to LA, LA is going to send for me. My phone will be ringing any minute now.' \"</p><p>But that never happened. Williams saw his acting career slipping away.</p><p>\"I was down in the dumps. I got really depressed,\" he says. \"Like, really depressed.\"</p><p>Then, months later, Williams received an unexpected fax outlining a character in a new show called <em>The Wire</em>.</p><p>It was the part for Omar Little.</p><p>\"I got to grow with an amazing group of people that I consider my <em>Wire</em> family,\" Williams says. \"That character changed my life. And that was my big break.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
