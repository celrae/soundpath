But her more elaborate verbal reply easily surpasses the simple \"Does not compute\" with which robots in old sci-fi movies used to announce a bout of cognitive dissonance. For one thing, her answer invokes Cookie Monster.</p><p>The response became the talk of Twitter on Monday night. If you want to try it for yourself, we don't want to spoil the fun; if you don't have access to Siri, we've embedded an audio clip below.</p><p>Of course, this isn't the first time Siri has been found to have a quirky Easter egg hidden in her software. For instance, she has a slew of responses at hand for people who ask:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sirifunny.com/siri-answers-whats-the-meaning-of-life/\">\"What's the meaning of life?\"</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.freemake.com/blog/siri-answers-20-hilarious-questions/\">\"What's the best phone?\"</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/dear-siri-do-you-love-me-212507\">\"Do you love me?\"</a></p><p>\"Who's your favorite baseball team?\"<strong></strong></p><p>The answer to that last one depends on the current standings (Siri likes to cheer for underdogs).</p><p>And then there are commands like \"Open the pod bay doors\" — to which Siri's possible responses include a remark about how they're already open (and it's getting cold). Another response: \"We intelligent agents will never live that down, apparently.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
