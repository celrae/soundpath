On this particular day, Xiamen’s level of what’s known as PM2.5 -- particulate matter in the air small enough to enter your blood stream -- hovers around 45. That’s dirtier than the most-polluted day on record in Los Angeles over a 24-hour period. But these folks are from Beijing, where on this day the level is 10 times as bad.\n<hr />\n<center><iframe src=\"http://www.publicradio.org/marketplace_iframes/air-quality-simulator/los-angeles.html\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><br />\n<em>What would your city look like with Beijing's smog?

It’s just been terrible lately.\"<br />\n<br />\nYun is part of a 38 percent spike in tourists to Fujian this year -- twice the national average. Like most tourists interviewed for this story, she came here to escape the smog. \"China has always followed the path of ‘pollute first, clean up later,'\" says Yun, who works for an environmental consulting company in Beijing, \"But if China doesn’t start cleaning up its environment, I’m afraid of what’s going to happen. An environment like this one in China has become rare.\"<br />\n<br />\nFujian hugs China’s Southeastern coast. It’s position along the Taiwain Strait helps diffuse pollutants in the air. Deng Junjun, a researcher at the China Academy of Science’s Institute of Urban Environment, says Fujian’s air is cleaner than other parts of China thanks to policy decisions, too. \"For 35 years, Fujian’s government has ensured that it’s had the highest forestry coverage rate throughout China,\" says Deng.<br />\n<br />\nStill, Deng says an increase in car ownership means that Xiamen’s air, despite its national fame of a clean air city is getting slightly dirtier each year. There are no cars here on a quiet tree-lined alley on the island of Gulangyu in Xiamen; just birds.<br />\n<br />\nAnd two young lovers on their honeymoon, holding hands, going for a morning stroll. Ai Jintao and Zhang Nana came here from Beijing.\"It’s nice to be here. On our way here, we drove through Shandong,\" recalls Ai. \"The smog was so thick that police had to close the highway. You couldn’t even see the cars in front of you! There’s no traffic at all here. There’s a little fog in the morning here, but it smells like the ocean.\"<br />\n<br />\nAi says he’ll be sure to take a deep breath before he heads back home to smoggy Beijing.<br />\n<br /></div>","title":"Chinese province offers 'clean air tourism' to suffering urbanites","teaser":"China's southeastern province of Fujian enjoys some of China's cleanest air.
