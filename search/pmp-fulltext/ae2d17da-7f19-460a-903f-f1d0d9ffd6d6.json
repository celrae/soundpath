The man <em>behind </em>Big Bird, Caroll Spinney, is 81 — and has no plans to step out of the suit any time soon.</p><p>\"I see no reason to quit,\" Spinney tells NPR's Scott Simon. \"I can't imagine walking away from being Big Bird. I mean, that's an awfully good job, and there's not too many of them. So, I just want to keep doing it until I can't do it anymore.\"</p><p><em>I Am Big Bird</em>, a new documentary about Spinney's lif<em>e, </em>opens May 5. Spinney talks with Simon about what it's like to play Big Bird, and also a much darker character: Oscar the Grouch.</p><hr /><h3>Interview Highlights</h3><p><strong>On how he created Big Bird's voice</strong></p><p>It's just my own voice, a little higher. When he first started, Jim Henson — who created Big Bird and Oscar — said Big Bird was just a big goofy guy. ... And I said, \"I think Big Bird might be more useful to the show if he were a child learning all the things we were teaching in the show.\" And so he didn't know the alphabet, even, for instance.</p><p><strong>On whether Big Bird and Oscar are different sides of his personality</strong></p><p>I think there's just an awful lot of me in Big Bird, but Oscar is pretty much — I think I know how he thinks because he thinks exactly the opposite of what I think is a good way to be. So the dark side of me [maybe] once in a while, but mostly it's the opposite side of how I am.</p><p><strong>On whether he minds that people don't necessarily know who he is</strong></p><p>I've been asked: Does it bother me that people don't know who you are? But they know Big Bird and Oscar. And I don't mind a bit because I know I can play them — and also good pay — and I get to take the pay home. Meanwhile, they're back at Sesame Street.<em></em></p><p><strong><em>At this point, Big Bird and Oscar join in the conversation — apparently it's news to them that Spinney's been getting paid all this time.
