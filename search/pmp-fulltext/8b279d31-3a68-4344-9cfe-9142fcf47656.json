Shave some off into a tortilla and you’ve got a <em>taco al pastor</em>, the classic Mexican street food.</p>\n<p>It’s a similar scene halfway across the world in Jerusalem. At the hole-in-the-wall Al Waary restaurant, there’s a vertical rotisserie of beef spinning next to the flames, flavored by tangy vinegar. Shave some off into a pita, and you’ve got shawarma — the quintessential Middle Eastern street meat.</p>\n<p>If you're thinking these beloved dishes might be linked, you're right. So we hit the street food trail to find out, starting in Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>“Shawarma is very, very interesting,” says Ali Qleibo, a Palestinian anthropologist, sitting at the Al Waary shawarma joint. The origin of the word shawarma comes from the Turkish word <em>çevirme, </em>which means \"turning.\"</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"600\" width=\"900\" alt=\"Ali Qleibo, a Palestinian anthropologist, in front of Al Waary shawarma stand in Jerusalem.\" title=\"Ali Qleibo, a Palestinian anthropologist, in front of Al Waary shawarma stand in Jerusalem.\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/11.JPG?itok=TDmojuYn\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Ali Qleibo, a Palestinian anthropologist, in front of Al Waary shawarma stand in Jerusalem.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Daniel Estrin</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_border cta_align-right\" data-entity-id=\"80053\" data-entity-title=\" Translations of Ottoman taco\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-80053\" class=\"node node-story-act contextual-links-region story-act-cta story-act-nid-80053 cta-type-custom-text cta-style-none_above clearfix\" about=\"/node/80053\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/80053\">Story Act: Translations of Ottoman taco</a></h2>\n<div class=\"contextual-links-wrapper\">\n<ul class=\"contextual-links\"><li class=\"node-edit first\"><a href=\"/node/80053/edit?destination=node/79958/edit\">Edit</a></li>\n<li class=\"node-delete last\"><a href=\"/node/80053/delete?destination=node/79958/edit\">Delete</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p><span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Story Act: Translations of Ottoman taco\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    Translations  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-image\">\n    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/gvlogo.jpeg?itok=UMHZFHvy\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div>\n<div class=\"field-body\">\n<p><a href=\"http://tr.globalvoicesonline.org/2015/05/yediginiz-tako-icin-osmanliya-tesekkur-edin/\">Türkçe: Yediğiniz Tako İçin Osmanlı İmparatorluğu'na Teşekkür Edin</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>You can find some version of shawarma everywhere in the Middle East where the Ottoman Empire once reigned.</p>\n<p>“Turks call it döner kebab; Greeks call it gyro; Iraqis call it kas,” Qleibo says. “This shows you the all-pervasive influence of the Ottoman Empire, because all the subjects of the Ottoman Empire eat shawarma even though they call it by different names.”</p>\n<p>Of course, the people of the Ottoman Empire didn’t all stay there. About 36,000 people under Ottoman rule left for Mexico between the late 19th and early 20th century.</p>\n<p>“People came from as far as Egypt. I found some people [who] came from Iraq,” says Theresa Alfaro-Velcamp, a history professor at Sonoma State University who has tracked the migration of Middle Easterners to Mexico. “The majority came from the Levant, as it was called during that time, which is now modern-day Lebanon and Syria.”</p>\n<p>The migrants left for the usual reasons: looking for economic opportunity, dodging army conscription and escaping sectarian violence. And when they arrived, they brought their food with them. “By the 1930s, there were restaurants that served shawarma,” says Jeffrey Pilcher, a historian and author of the book \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Planet-Taco-Global-History-Mexican/dp/0199740062\">Planet Taco</a>.\"</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"506\" width=\"900\" alt=\"A shawarma sandwich in Jerusalem.
