The scientists conclude that the coral reefs in the area are declining rapidly, and the key drivers are local factors: overfishing, tourism, population growth and the collapse of the parrot fish population.</p><p>Scientist Jeremy Jackson, lead author of the report and senior adviser on coral reefs to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), wrote: &#8220;Even if we could somehow make climate change disappear tomorrow, these reefs would continue their decline.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Nancy Knowlton</strong>, a leading marine biologist, told <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson that while we have lost a lot of living coral, &#8220;the more important message from this report is that there are actually places that are doing quite well, places where people and government have decided to take care of coral reefs.
