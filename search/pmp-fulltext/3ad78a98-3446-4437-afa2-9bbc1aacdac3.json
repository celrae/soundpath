The team says it needs a new stadium, and there&#8217;s a chance the team will move elsewhere if that doesn&#8217;t happen.</p><p>Mayor <strong>Kevin Faulconer</strong> discussed the challenges facing the city with <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young, who is broadcasting from San Diego this week.</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;Our target here in the city of San Diego is to reduce the water use by 16 percent.&#8221;</p><p></div></p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a way of life here in San Diego for a number of years,&#8221; said Faulconer about San Diegans&#8217; water conservation habits. &#8220;It&#8217;s not new to us here in San Diego, but the drought here of course is real and it&#8217;s been one of the most severe droughts we&#8217;ve ever faced in California.&#8221;</p><p>Faulconer says San Diegans have conserved water at rates in the double digits since 2007, but with California&#8217;s new mandatory restrictions going into effect across the state, the city needs to do more to comply with the new rules.</p><p>&#8220;Different water districts have different targets,&#8221; said Faulconer. &#8220;Our target here in the city of San Diego is to reduce the water use by 16 percent.&#8221;</p><p>The city is focusing on reducing water used for outdoor landscaping. Residents are urged to water their lawns and gardens no more than twice a week, and public workers are being pressed into service to <a href=\"https://hereandnow.wbur.org/2015/06/01/san-diego-water-cops\">enforce</a> these restrictions.</p><p>&#8220;We have to pull together as a region,&#8221; said Faulconer.</p><p>Faulconer said San Diego is developing a recycled water program to reuse a third of the city&#8217;s water supply, and said he hopes it will be running by 2021.</p><p>&#8220;When completed, we will create a third of our city&#8217;s water supply from recycled water,&#8221; said Faulconer. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be one of the most ambitious projects in the country and one we&#8217;re pretty proud of.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.sandiego.gov/mayor/about/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Faulconer</a></strong>, mayor of San Diego, California.
