But she's also devoting herself to a different project: Teaching kids back in Libya.</p>\n<p>The volatile security situation there has kept kids out of school since October. So if kids can't get to their classrooms, El-Zahawi thought, why not bring the classroom to them? The <a href=\"http://www.benghazischool.com/\">Benghazi Skype School</a> was born.</p>\n<p>\"We started with a personal account and a Skype,\" says El-Zahawi from New York. She posted about her project on social media, asking Libyans if they were able to help. Within a week, she was receiving \"a really huge and positive response.\" She even heard from an IT company in Libya that wanted to sponsor her project.</p>\n<p>Of course, Internet classrooms have their own problems. Patchy Internet connections are a major hurdle, as are the frequent power outages that Libyans face. \"We try and make [the classes] live as much as we can, but due to the problems ... we try to record the lessons and post them online,\" El-Zahawi says.</p>\n<p>But despite the challenges, the Benghazi Skype School has been a success so far. \"Families send us pictures of the students doing their homework,\" El-Zahawi says. \"They're even wearing their school uniforms.\"</p>\n<p>The bigger idea behind the school, El-Zahawi says, is to bring hope to the families and kids who \"really need it.\" She's worried about news like <a href=\"http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-02-17/isis-spreads-its-tentacles-north-africa-and-threatens-reach-further\">the recent beheading of a group of men</a> in Libya at the hands of ISIS, and she hopes that educating Libyan children will help stop the spread of radicalization.</p>\n<p>\"We have to educate our kids,\" she says, \"Only by learning, we can fight.\"</p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-02-26%2Flibyan-kids-have-been-out-school-months-one-woman-wants-bring-classroom-them&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0226201506.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0226201506mp3"}]}
