Twenty years ago, on the same day President Bill Clinton took his first oath of office, Wood was born in Seoul, South Korea, to a single mother who couldn’t afford to raise him.

Two years later, he became a citizen.</p>\n<p>“I’ve always wanted to go back to Korea and explore, see how these people live,” said Wood. “It’s something that I’m definitely proud of, because it’s part of my heritage -- even though I’m not the most Korean of people.”</p>\n<p>Wood’s notions of what life would be like if he’d grown up in his birthplace -- and what it means to be Korean -- are drawn mostly from befriending Korean foreign exchange students that attended private school with him in Arizona. They told him about the hyper-competitive educational environment in South Korea, where 14-hour study days are the norm and team sports are rare.</p>\n<p>South Korea came in second in a recent assessment of the education system of 50 countries by the education firm Pearson, while the U.S. came in 17th.</p>\n<p>“Pretty much their entire life is homework and devoted to studies,” said Wood. “Here, I do my studies, but I have a lot of time to do sports and all of the other stuff in life.”</p>\n<p>Wood said he is obsessed with sports. His father coached his youth soccer team. He was on the soccer and basketball teams in high school. He says he watches almost every Phoenix Suns game. He says friends even call him “the Encyclopedia of NBA.” Now at Concordia University in Irvine, Calif., Wood studies business with an emphasis on sports management, hoping to someday work for a professional sports team.</p>\n<p>Alongside this steady diet of sports, education is hugely important for Wood and his family. Wood’s mother Jane never went to college, but she has labored to give her children what she couldn’t have. Despite job experience as a financial analyst for American Express, she says her lack of degree has been a hindrance.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t have the opportunity that Matthew has today,” Jane Wood said. “If I wanted something, if I didn’t work for it, I didn’t get it.”</p>\n<p>After adopting Matthew and younger sister Kayla (also from South Korea), Jane and her husband, who works for a lumber supplier in Glendale, put money away in mutual funds for the kids’ college. Matthew Wood pays for a portion of his $40,000 tuition bill with academic scholarships. He took out whatever loans he could get, and his family covers the rest.</p>\n<p>“I think I have more opportunity because my parents didn’t have as much as I do,” said Wood, sitting in the dining room of the home he’s grown up in since coming to the U.S. “In that regard, I guess you could say I do have more chances. But it’s also hard to get a job now.”</p>\n<p>Wood voted for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012 and considers himself conservative.
