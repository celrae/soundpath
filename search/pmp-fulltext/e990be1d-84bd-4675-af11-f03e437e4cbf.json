In <em>Now You See Me</em>, he mastered magic tricks. In <em>Rio</em>, his animated macaw learned to fly, and his Lex Luthor will soon be nemesis-ing the caped crusader in <em>Batman Vs. Superman</em>. But it's safe to say that none of those pictures asked half as much of Eisenberg as Richard Ayoade's <em>The Double</em>, which requires him, pretty literally, to meet himself coming and going.</p><p>Eisenberg plays Simon James, a milquetoast of a man, so meek and mild he goes through life unnoticed, and I don't mean that as a figure of speech. Seriously, people don't notice Simon James. Not his boss who greets him as if he's a brand new employee after seven years on the job. Not the office building's entry guard who has demanded his ID every morning of those seven years. Not his co-workers, or his neighbors, or the copy machine gal (Mia Wasilowska) on whom he has a crush, though she's never learned his name.</p><p>Simon James simply makes no impression on people. Then one day, a new guy shows up who is less invisible than Simon James — James Simon (Eisenberg again). And to Simon's consternation, James is instantly an office superstar — popular, outgoing, the boss' pet, and the copy machine gal's big crush. This, although no one but Simon seems to notice that they look alike. Asked if James reminds him of anyone, a co-worker replies \"who'd you have in mind.\"</p><p>Ayoade, who's a comedian as well as a filmmaker, gives all of this zip and comic timing, though he's not made <em>The Double</em> funny, exactly. He's made it weird and dark and fiercely retro (Terry Gilliam's <em>Brazil</em> is an obvious inspiration), and filled it with clanking, groaning machines (that copier is the size of a small tank) to complement the office drones who act like cogs in a bigger machine.</p><p>This workplace-as-hellscape is not new territory, exactly — the story's based on Dostoevsky, plays like Kafka, and looks like an Orwellian nightmare. But who'd complain, since it lets Jesse Eisenberg offer what amounts to an acting master-class, illuminating diametrically opposed personalities as his nebbishy Simon and his increasingly manipulative James do things as ordinary as sitting down together in a diner.</p><p>Simon will ultimately come out of his shell, as his double's behavior veers into double-dealing and double-crosses, the devil in an existential hell that'll be familiar to fans of Russian literature, but that in a film at the multiplex, especially in blockbuster season, is as dark and as dazzling as it is rare.</p><p>Which of course, makes <em>The Double</em> doubly welcome.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
