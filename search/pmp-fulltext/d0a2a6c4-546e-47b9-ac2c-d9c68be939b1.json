It's the season to sit outside, decompress and finally put those accumulated sick days to good use: It's vacation season.</p><p>Vacation traditionally means taking a break from all of the stresses, worries and routines of our daily lives. We put the work down in order to pick up a cool drink and a new novel.</p><p>So let's make sure we have everything:</p><p>Flip-flops? Check.</p><p>Suntan lotion? Check.</p><p>Cellphone? Laptop? iPad? Hmm.</p><p>Believe it or not, some people put down the smartphone, avoid their email, and stay off of social media for more than a few hours at a time.</p><p>Mat Honan puts himself in situations where he doesn't even have the option of using technology. He goes camping.</p><p>\"I love to go out,\" says Honan, a senior writer at <em>Wired </em>magazine<em>.</em></p><p>Honan says he loves being online, but he thinks \"there's value in <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/10/honan/\">spending time in quiet reflection</a>.\"</p><p>\"That's something we've known for thousands of years,\" he says. \"Very hard to be reflective when you're distracted by these streams that have something interesting.\"</p><p>So whether it's for a week or a few days, the tech writer says take a break: Just unplug.</p><p>Paul Baier, a software company executive, takes breaks from social media a little bit more seriously â€” he pays for it.</p><p>Or at least he did.</p><p>Baier's daughter, just now finishing her sophomore year of high school, knew her father thought she spent too much time on Facebook. So, halfway through her freshman year, the now 15-year-old put a deal on the table: If Baier paid her, she would <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/07/business/la-fi-tn-daughter-facebook-break-200-20130207\">stay off Facebook</a>.</p><p>The sentence? Six months off social media.</p><p>The price? $200.</p><p>\"I thought she was joking,\" says Baier. \"I said you couldn't live without Facebook.\"</p><p>But she did, and with ease. And she was baffled when the Internet and TV went crazy with her story. She turned down all interviews.</p><p>And this isn't the only story of its kind.</p><p>A teacher waived an exam for students who <a href=\"http://www.kare11.com/story/news/education/2014/05/20/cell-phone-final-test-high-school-technology-kimball-test-math/9342939/\">agreed to give up their phones</a>. Another writer <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4279674/im-still-here-back-online-after-a-year-without-the-internet\">stayed off the Internet, entirely, for a year</a>.
