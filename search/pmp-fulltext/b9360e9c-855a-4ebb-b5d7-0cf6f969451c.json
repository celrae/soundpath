But this early summer crop of hits also suggests a welcome widening of the lens when it comes not just to women’s roles, but men’s as well.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"NPR Obvious Child\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/06/13/321638235/-obvious-child-a-momentous-film-of-small-embarrassing-truths\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>NPR</strong>: &#8217;Obvious Child&#8217;: A Momentous Film Of Small, Embarrassing Truths </a>&#8211; &#8220;Director Gillian Robespierre has a good last name for a revolutionary. But it&#8217;s not a revolution with placards and manifestos. It&#8217;s a revolution of small, embarrassing truths. <em>Obvious Child </em>begins with Donna, played by Jenny Slate, standing before a mic in a Williamsburg, Brooklyn, club making fun of her Jewish features and her farts and implying it&#8217;s a miracle she even has a boyfriend. That boyfriend, Ryan, is standing in the back, scowling. He doesn&#8217;t seem to like her exhibitionism. In fact, he&#8217;s fixing to dump her. &#8221;</p><p><a title=\"TIME Hollywood Female Films\" href=\"http://time.com/2811177/maleficent-female-summer-blockbusters/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TIME</strong>: How Hollywood Can Get More Women To See Movies </a>&#8211; &#8220;Getting a lot of women to see your movie is not<em>essential</em> to its success. Superhero and monster movies will continue to draw big crowds: <em>Spider-Man</em>, <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Godzilla</em>all had at least $90 million opening weekends. But courting more women certainly doesn’t hurt. After all, females make up 51% of the population.&#8221;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
