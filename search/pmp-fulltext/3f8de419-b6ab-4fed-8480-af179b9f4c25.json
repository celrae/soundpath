Red beans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> They’ll kill you if you don’t use red beans.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> A radical question: If you didn’t like Cajun food, because it has a distinct flavor profile, but this is your job, and they ask you “Guess what, we’re going to New Orleans”, you just have to pretend you like it?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> I don’t know. I like to say I’m sort of a perfect omnivore in that way. It has never crossed my mind. There’s nothing that I’m not excited to try. I don’t know. Quite frankly, you’re an idiot if you don’t like cajun food, so that’s that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> All right, it was that kind of sharp insight that we’re hoping you’ll bring to these ?? questions. We’ve got a few for you. A number of them, you may not be surprised, are food-oriented.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> Sure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<h2>Well done, please</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Here’s something from Melissa in Tampa, Florida. Melissa writes, she starts with a scenario. “You are eating dinner at someone’s house, and you are served undercooked chicken. Do you ask to have it cooked again? Do you eat around the edges? Do you not eat it, or do you eat it and take your chances?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> Here’s what I would do. It also depends on whose house you’re at. If you’re at your best friend’s house, you’re at your mom’s house, yeah. You have them cook it again. No problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Don’t try to kill me again, Mom.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> If you’re at a stranger’s house, and you’re trying to be polite, I’d probably eat around the edges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Yeah, I like that she offered, though.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> Yeah. I would probably have a few bites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> But, aren’t you digging a deeper hole for yourself? Then it’s like, hey, why aren’t you finishing your meal?</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> No, because you eat other things.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Yeah, but what if you’re the expert. This is different from Melissa, but if you eat around the edges, everyone else is “This must be good. They eat the whole thing”. They all get sick.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> Here’s the thing about undercooked chicken. Certainly you want to be careful and salmonella and other food-borne illnesses exist, for sure. But, it’s still rare, and if it’s really undercooked, that’s an issue and you should absolutely tell the person, in a nice way that is not “Your food is terrible” but is, “This is a little undercooked. I think it’s kind of pink. Cook it a little longer”.</p>\n<br />\n<p>I actually think that, when cooking chicken at home, the opposite tends to happen because people are so petrified that it’s always overcooked, and then it’s hard to swallow because it’s so dry and terrible. And, you don’t need to do that, either.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> All right, so Melissa, be careful, but don’t get so paranoid that your host has to destroy the meal for you.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Wine and Dine, or save for another time?</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> So, our next question comes from Roseanne. She sent it via Twitter. Roseanne writes: “When a guest brings wine, are they expected us to serve it at that dinner? Husband and I disagree on the subject.” A classic, and I don’t know the answer to it.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote data-pullquote=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> That’s a great question. I don’t think that there’s a set rule. I think you should always go expecting either to happen. If you’re going to bring a wine and you know that that’s been your role, they’ve told you to bring the wine or whatever it is, or you get there and they don’t have a ton of wine, yes. Absolutely. Open it. Drink it. But, <q>I’ve been in plenty of cases where I’ve brought wine hoping we would drink it. I kind of wanted to drink it myself.</q></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Yeah, I just sprung for the nice wine.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Yeah, this isn’t a gift. This is for me.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> Right, and then they have tons of wine and they put it away, and that’s fine, too. My husband and I sometimes disagree on this, because we’ll bring a really special bottle of wine somewhere and they don’t open it and, not that it’s up to us, that we want it, but you think “Oh, we brought this to share with everyone”. But, I think you have to just go in with no expectations and let the host lead, depending on what they’ve planned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> So, there’s no real rule of thumb.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> I don’t think there is, and if there is, I haven’t heard one. Because, here’s what can also happen: you can get somewhere and bring wine, just as a gift, without being asked to bring it, but the person has prepared special pairings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> I’ve got a suggestion, though. If you brought in something that you really think people just have to try and you want to experience that with them, can’t you, maybe, pre-dinner, say “listen, this may not go with dinner, but you guys have to try this.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> Yes. Absolutely. I’ve had so many times where someone’s come over with a great bottle and said “This is so great. We really have to open this during dinner. I really want everyone to have a taste”. And, that’s great.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I think that’s actually the dividing line. It’s what happens before. If they tell you to bring a wine, expect to drink it. But, if you’re just bringing a bottle of wine to be nice, because that’s kind of customary, you’re on the fence, so don’t spend more than $13. Who knows?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> I think that if you’re just bringing a wine because it’s your gift, have no expectations either way, and I think it’s in the host’s hands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Don’t expect to drink it. Yeah. Or, you could just keep guzzling all the wine until they get to your wine.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> Exactly. Which I’ve also done… not pregnant, but I have often done it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<h2>Own your kitchen failures</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Here’s the last question. It comes from Beebs in Los Angeles.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> Hi, Beebs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> I don’t know, maybe she works at the BBC. Beebs asks: “If you cook something for guests, and it is a fail, is it better to acknowledge, or pull a Julia Child and try to pass it off as fine?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> If it’s a real fail, I say, acknowledge it. Make light of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Own it, right?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote data-pullquote=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> And then you all can get back in the kitchen together and do something else. Oh yeah, own your mistakes. I’ve certainly had dinner parties where I’ve made something and it wasn’t as planned. Now, generally, we all tend to be harder on ourselves than our guests are going to be. <q>You know, how many times have I also been to a dinner party and someone is serving something and apologizing for it and I’m like “I don’t care, this is perfectly great. I’m happy just to be invited to your house. What do I care?”</q></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s also because you’re Gail, though, right? They really want to impress you.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> True enough, but I think it is very personal and people put a lot of pressure on themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> That’s a good point. It’s the community. The idea of a dinner party, there’s two parts. There’s the food, okay, but it’s really about community and having people over.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> Absolutely!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Now that I know your answer, expect a dinner party invitation soon, because I can just burn something.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> Thanks. I’ll be nice about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> You’ll be nice about it. Great to know.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Gail Simmons, thanks so much for telling our audience how to behave.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Gail Simmons:</strong> Thanks, guys!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br /></div>","published":"2013-11-15T08:22:50+00:00","audio":[{"format":"MP3","href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/dinnerpartydownload/2013/11/15/1115_simmons_128.mp3","type":"audio/mpeg","meta":{"duration_hms":"00:08:22","duration":502,"api":{"href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm_audio:/dinnerpartydownload/2013/11/15/1115_simmons","type":"application/json"}}}]}
