We’ll take a closer look at ISIS and its Islamic State vision.</p><p>Until they came bursting into Mosul last month with black flags and pick-up trucks, ISIS was – to most Americans – just part of a chaotic jumble of fighters in Syria.  The next thing we knew, they had taken over a huge swath of Iraq, declared themselves the Islamic State, and announced a new caliphate in the heart of the Middle East.  This weekend the self-proclaimed caliph of the caliphate – Abu Bakr al Baghdadi – purportedly stepped out of the shadows and spoke to the world.  They’re too brutal for al Qaeda.  They literally crucify.  And right now they rule.  This hour On Point:  ISIS and the Islamic State.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: right\"><strong>&#8211; Tom Ashbrook</strong></p><h4>Guests</h4><p><a title=\"Rania Abouzeid\" href=\"http://www.raniaabouzeid.com/Rania_Abouzeid/Main_Page.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rania Abouzeid</strong></a>, independent journalist covering the Middle East.

It has made clear that it expects people under its power to take an active role in establishing a new Islamic state.
