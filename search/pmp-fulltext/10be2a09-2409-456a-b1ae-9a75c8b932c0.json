At the University of Texas at Austin, thousands of students have petitioned the school to remove a statue of Jefferson Davis, who was president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War.</p><p>Professor <strong>Don Carleton</strong> says the statue was actually intended to be part of a display about the country unifying after the war, and while he agrees that it should be removed from the campus, he told <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson that it should still be preserved.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a moving target, but at first I thought we should just put plaques up explaining why those statues are there. They&#8217;re totally out of context,&#8221; Carleton said. &#8220;But now I think we&#8217;ve reached a point where we probably ought to go ahead and remove the statues from their present location, move them to a more appropriate place. And I think a more appropriate place would be more in a museum setting.&#8221;</p><p>Recent events, namely the shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, have intensified the debate, he said.</p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a seismic shift in public opinion, and I think we have to take that into consideration,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Carleton said &#8220;there&#8217;s no litmus test&#8221; for what statues or other historical artifacts to remove and when, and that government officials have to rely on common sense and the pulse of the people.</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a seismic shift in public opinion, and I think we have to take that into consideration.&#8221;</p><p></div></p><p>&#8220;The Confederate flag for example, I&#8217;m against destroying the flag, the battle flag,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People can happily fly that from their homes if they want to, because that&#8217;s freedom of speech. But what we&#8217;re talking about here is government. We have to get away from the idea that we&#8217;re destroying history.&#8221;</p><p>So where &#8211; as critics like Houston Mayor Annise Parker asked &#8211; does it end? If today it&#8217;s a statue of Jefferson Davis, could a statue of President George Washington, who owned slaves, be next?</p><p>&#8220;Jefferson Davis was never president of the United States, and he led a rebellion. He was a traitor,&#8221; Carleton said. &#8220;And he was never elected by the people of the United States to be president of the United States. So you can&#8217;t compare him to George Washington.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cah.utexas.edu/about/bio_drcarleton.php\" target=\"_blank\">Don Carleton</a></strong>, professor at the University of Texas, Austin and executive director at the <a href=\"https://www.cah.utexas.edu/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Briscoe Center for American History</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
