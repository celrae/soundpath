I grew up around church people. My mother was a hippie, more so. She sang rock and folk and R&B music. So I grew up listening to the complete opposite, more secular music. But I had a great aunt that sang just like Mahalia Jackson and she would play her music. Her song was ‘Walk Around Heaven All Day,’ that was her spiritual that they would call my Great Aunt Gussie to sing, and that’s how I was introduced to Mahalia Jackson, through Gussie.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;I’m in my purpose and I’m understanding my power.&#8221;</p><p></div></p><p><strong>On how she feels about her career </strong></p><p>&#8220;I’m so elated that every year something amazing happens every time I put out an album, and it lets me know that I’m on the right track and I’m in my purpose and I’m understanding my power and I’m living in it and I’m having a great time.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I’m so comfortable in my own skin. People are accepting my diversity and music. I have nothing to complain about, and I’m able to just be me. I’m happy. I’m self aware. I understand my power, and I’m having a fun time. I can’t complain about any of this, whether it went my way or it didn’t go my way, it’s a way.&#8221;</p><h4>Songs In This Segment</h4><ul><li>Rev. Thomas A.
