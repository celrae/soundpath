But the setting is particularly challenging for vocalists, especially those accustomed to heavy production, effects or — in the case of recent guest T-Pain — generous dollops of Auto-Tune.</p><p>T-Pain's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/359661053/t-pain-tiny-desk-concert\">effects-less set</a> grabbed more attention at the time, given the extent to which digital alterations are expected of him, but this performance by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2014/04/28/307506331/song-premiere-banks-goddess\">Banks</a> is, in its own way, an even greater high-wire act. Banks' terrific full-length debut, <em>Goddess</em>, is constructed out of layer upon layer of electronics, beats, samples and other means of submerging the singer's voice in swirling accoutrements. With assistance from keyboardist/guitarist John Anderson and percussionist Derek Taylor, she's not all alone behind the Tiny Desk, but her expressive voice is fully exposed here.</p><p>Kicking off her three-song set with \"Beggin For Thread,\" Banks sets the scene in vulnerable, breathily seething fashion before opening the throttle in her choruses. On record, she's placed at the center of lavish productions, each suitable for throbbing remixes and banks of swirling lights. At the Tiny Desk, though, she serves notice that she's a powerful singer in her own right — and that heavy production needn't be the product of necessity.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"Beggin For Thread\"</li><li>\"Alibi\"</li><li>\"Brain\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Maggie Starbard; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Becky Lettenberger, Maggie Starbard; Assistant Producer: James Clark; photo by James Clark/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
