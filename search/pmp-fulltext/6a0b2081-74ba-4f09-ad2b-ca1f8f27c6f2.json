But near the end of the night, we started hearing news of a terrible accident involving dozens of people outside another venue.</p><p>At about 12:30 a.m., two people were killed and 23 others injured after a suspected drunken driver, now in police custody, drove a car through barricades on Red River Street and struck pedestrians near The Mohawk.

You can hear a little bit about how the whole night felt to the <em>All Songs Considered</em> team by listening to the podcast in the audio player on this page. As our own Ann Powers puts it, \"In the midst of this joy, you never know what's going to happen, and that's why the joy is all that more precious.\"</p><p>We'll have more coverage from SXSW all week on NPR Music.</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>The Austin Police Department held a press conference at 10:30 a.m. CT to review the condition of those injured in the incident and give an update on the progress of the investigation. SXSW managing director Roland Swenson spoke during the press conference and said that organizers would like to go home to recover from the shock of the event, but that the festival feels \"some obligation to the people who have traveled here from around the world\" to continue events as scheduled.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
