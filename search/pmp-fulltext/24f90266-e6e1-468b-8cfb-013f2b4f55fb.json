It’s got SeaWorld. it’s like all the great American theme parks rolled into one,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Rowland was a little nervous. Was this the sort of place you could do an accounting internship? He says the program officer assured him it’d be a good fit. \"I was just envisioning a kind of corporate job in their headquarters or whatever,\" remembers Rowland.</p>\n<p>Keenan Madson, who plans to major in physics at Gustavus Adolphus University in Minnesota, says he was told he could do an engineering and design internship at the park.</p>\n<p>But the amusement park boss had another idea.</p>\n<p>Once the group of Americans arrived, they were handed costumes.

That’s exactly what I looked like,\" says Madson.</p>\n<p>And that’s the moment Madson realized he had traveled 10,000 miles around the planet so that he could greet visitors at the front gate of a Chinese amusement park. His job was to wear a candy cane striped suit and collect entrance tickets from Chinese tourists. Intern Mark Rowland -- the accounting major -- was given a safari costume to wear. He was told he’d be working inside the park’s zoo.</p>\n<p>After two days of this, all but one of the American interns at Chimelong quit. Amusement park staff told students the South China Internship program had misidentified them as hospitality students. And they were now on their own -- four American students, stuck in China, homeless, crashing on the couches of other expatriate Americans who felt sorry for them. \"We were just couchsurfing after we left the employee dorms,\" says Rowland.</p>\n<p>In the end, two students flew back to the U.S., Rowland left for Shanghai, and Madson roamed around China staying with friends until the South China Internship Program found a new placement for him. \"Was there not enough oversight? Yes. Were their mistakes made in the initial communication process? Yes. We’ve already tried to address this matter,\" says Glenn Shive, director of the Hong Kong America Center.</p>\n<p>His center received a $200,000 grant from the Ford Foundation to partner with the United International College in the city of Zhuhai to run the South China Internship Program for three years.

But he says the problems could’ve been ironed out had the students stuck around. When you come to China to work, says Shive, the first thing you need to do is reset your expectations. \"Anything that’s in their minds that they have coming off the airplane, to say 'I’m here, I’m ready, you told me this this and this, and it’s not there,' and I’m saying this person is going to have a hard time in China,\" says Shive.</p>\n<p>If there’s an expert on U.S. students doing internships in China, it’s Jeremy Friedlein.
