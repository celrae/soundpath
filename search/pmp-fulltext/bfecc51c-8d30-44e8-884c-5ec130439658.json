In 1971, more than 70 percent of Congressional representatives were veterans. Today, that group makes up less than 18 percent.</p><p>But still, a number of military veterans are among the new Congress members set to swear in on Tuesday. Republican Lee Zeldin of New York who served in the Army in Iraq, and Democrats Seth Moulton and Ruben Gallego, both Marines in the same war, are a few examples.</p><p>With the new changes and fresh faces coming to the House of Representatives and the Senate, what will that mean for veterans across the country? And how big of an impact do military veteran lawmakers make once they are elected?</p><p><strong>Peter Feaver</strong> of Duke University discusses this with <a href=\"https://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Here & Now&#8217;</em></a>s Lisa Mullins.</p><h4>Interview Highlights</h4><p><strong>On veterans in Congress supporting war</strong></p><p>&#8220;At the individual level you expect some variance, at the aggregate level though if you look at if over 150 years of experience the percentage of veterans in Congress is associated with the actual performance of American foreign policy. The more veterans [we have] in Congress the less likely the U.S. is to initiate the use of force, <em>but</em> if force is used it will be a at a higher rate of escalation, and the inverse is true.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On veteran and military spending </strong></p><p>&#8220;Politicians regardless of the party tend to be supportive of more spending on veteran benefits&#8230;[However,] the pressure on defense spending is increasing, and pay and compensation and particularly the health cost of veterans is crowding out spending on active duty military.&#8221;</p><p><strong>The big question</strong></p><p>&#8220;Do you pay for the military you used to have or do you pay for the military you will need now and in future?&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://polisci.duke.edu/people?Gurl=&Uil=1572&subpage=profile\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Feaver</a></strong>, professor of political science and public policy at Duke University, where he studies civil-military relations.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
