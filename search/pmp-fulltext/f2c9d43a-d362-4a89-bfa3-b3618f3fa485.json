Since Saturday, black ice has caused hundreds of accidents and at least five deaths.</p><p><strong>Doyle Rice</strong>, who covers weather and climate for USA Today, joined <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson to explain this winter threat, including why it happens and what to do if you encounter black ice on the roads.</p><p>He explained that black ice is actually clear &#8212; the blacktop pavement can be seen through this thin, all-but-invisible layer of ice. The danger of black ice comes from it being so difficult to spot.</p><h4>Tips For Driving On Black Ice</h4><p>If you&#8217;re anticipating possible black ice:</p><ul><li>Turn your lights on.</li><li>Drive slowly and don&#8217;t tailgate.</li><li>If the roads look wet or dark, watch the vehicle in front of you. If the wheels aren&#8217;t leaving tracks or spraying water, it is likely black ice.</li><li>Do not use cruise control.</li><li>If you drive a manual transmission, shift to a lower gear for more control.</li></ul><p>If you hit black ice:</p><ul><li>Stay calm and keep the wheel steady. Don&#8217;t make any sudden movements.</li><li>Slowly lift your foot off the accelerator to slow down &#8212; don&#8217;t hit the brakes.</li><li>Don&#8217;t over-correct your steering if you feel the car sliding.</li><li>Hopefully your tires will soon find traction. Once they do, try to find a safe location (not the shoulder of the road) to park.</li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/staff/782/doyle-rice/\" target=\"_blank\">Doyle Rice</a></strong>, covers weather and climate for USA Today.
