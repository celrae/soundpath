But <strong>Pejman Sayas, </strong>owner of Salon Pejman in Washington, D.C., says that is not a good idea.</p><p>&#8220;People should wash their hair two to three times a week at most, &#8221; he told <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson. &#8220;I wash my hair once a week.&#8221;</p><p>Sayas says shampooing dries out hair &#8212; even for those with an oily scalp. The sodium chloride and sulfate in many shampoos are harsh on hair, he says, and will strip it of oils and nutrients. Shampoo residue can also lead to scalp irritation.</p><p>In between days of hair washing, Sayas suggests that washing hair with water and conditioning the ends if needed. He also suggests buying hair products that are free of sodium chloride, sulfates and alcohol.</p><p>For people who work out and sweat daily who want to get the clean feeling back, Sayas recommends rinsing hair very well with lukewarm &#8212; &#8220;never hot water&#8221; &#8212; and conditioning the hair.</p><p>Sayas says it may take hair a week or two to adjust to the new regimen of not washing hair daily.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Pejman Sayas, </strong>owner of <a href=\"http://salonpejmangeorgetown.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Salon Pejman</a> in Washington, D.C.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
