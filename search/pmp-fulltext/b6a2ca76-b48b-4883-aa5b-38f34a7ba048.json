Now it is two or three patients a week. ... But this trend [of improvement] isn’t inevitable.

She remembers arriving in a village in Guinea last summer where residents were hostile to health workers — even as the epidemic was in full swing.</p>\n<p>\"Some health workers had actually been attacked,\" Mazumdar says. \"I remember going in there and people were, understandably, utterly terrified. They didn't understand this thing. They've had several members of that community die in this very harrowing way. They didn't know what was happening.\"</p>\n<p>But as time went on, she says, people’s understanding of the epidemic changed. “I went to Freetown a couple of months later. The buckets of chlorine were outside every public building; we had our temperatures checked five to six times a day; there were Ebola posters everywhere telling people to avoid body contact because that’s how it’s spread,\" Mazumdar says.</p>\n<p>And while the number of cases may be coming down, Mazumdar, like Johnson, cautions that Ebola will require continued vigilance on the part of health workers as well as journalists. “This is far from over,\" she says, \"and as it continues in Sierra Leone [and] Guinea, the rest of [the] West African countries and, indeed, the world remain at risk.”</p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"http://emp.bbc.co.uk/emp/embed/smpEmbed.html?playlist=http%3A%2F%2Fplaylists.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld-africa-29512760A%2Fplaylist.sxml&amp;title=Burial%20teams%20in%20Sierra%20Leone%20are%20having%20to%20scramble%20over%20fresh%20graves%20to%20lay%20bodies%20to%20rest%2C%20as%20Tulip%20Mazumdar%20reports&amp;product=news&amp;lang=en-gb\" width=\"400\"></iframe></p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-03-24%2Fpast-year-long-fight-against-ebola-filled-stories-great-sadness-and-resilience&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/story/images/Ebola%20Jouney%20%284%29.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/ebola-jouney-4jpg"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0324201506.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0324201506mp3"}]}
