But what started as separate sets during a mutual tour, then a few walk-ons during Leo's solo set, is now an adventure in collaboration and mutual songwriting — and the birth of The Both. Months after this Tiny Desk Concert, which we recorded in February, there's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/04/06/297716051/first-listen-the-both-the-both\">an album</a>. For the announcement of that record, Leo said, \"The writing process has largely been long-distance, but it's been line by line, verse by verse, part by part; we'll send each other something and go back and forth until it's finished.\"</p><p>When they showed up to play together at the Tiny Desk, there was a lot of uncertainty and a sense of adventure. The performances weren't about perfection so much as inspiration, with Mann rocking a bit more and Leo hunting for subtlety in his guitar playing. It wasn't compromise, though, so much as a creative challenge that's unfolding during this set — one of their earliest public performances of these songs. It's fascinating to watch them sing in uncharted territory.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><p><ul></p><p><li>\"You Can't Help Me Now\"</li></p><p><li>\"Milwaukee\"</li></p><p><li>\"No Sir\"</li></p><p><li>\"The Gambler\"</li></p><p></ul></p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><strong></strong><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Olivia Merrion, Meredith Rizzo; photo by Jim Tuttle/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
