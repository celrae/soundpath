They&#8217;re called &#8220;workampers&#8221; (a contraction of working and camping) and they travel across the country in their RVs, often performing seasonal work, selling fireworks, pumpkins, Christmas trees. They even work part-time in huge Amazon warehouses.</p><p>Many of these people say they love the work, which they need for the income. But there are obvious downsides. They don&#8217;t have health care and they don&#8217;t have unions to protect them.</p><p><strong>Jessica Bruder</strong> is author of the story, &#8220;The End Of Retirement: When You Can&#8217;t Afford To Stop Working,&#8221; in the August issue of Harper&#8217;s.

They&#8217;re ready to go and they disappear when you don&#8217;t need them.
