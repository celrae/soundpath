Since it is so hard to remember all those passwords, consider using a free password manager such as <a href=\"https://lastpass.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LastPass</a> or <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2407168,00.asp\" target=\"_blank\">find others here.</a></p><p>2. <strong>Use a firewall and virus checker for your computers:</strong> There are several good free or low-cost packages. You can find recommended by reputable organizations such as <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/products/1645\" target=\"_blank\">PCWorld Magazine</a> or <a href=\"http://consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/04/free-security-software-keeps-you-safe-online/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Consumer Reports</a>.</p><p>3. <strong>Make sure your home wireless network requires a strong password: </strong>But also<strong> </strong>consider registering your devices with your router to disallow rogue devices from joining your home network. See your router’s owner’s manual for how to do this.</p><p>4. <strong>Consider using privacy protecting technologies when surfing the Web: You can use </strong>non-tracking search engines such as <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DuckDuckGo</a> and <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5935863/five-best-vpn-service-providers\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Private Networks</a> (VPNs) that are available for free or at low cost.</p><p>5. <strong>Be aware of your surroundings:</strong> Avoid shady sites that can download malware; do not click links in your emails but rather navigate to the site instead using a search engine. And make sure to use a credit card for online transactions that guarantees zero liability.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.rand.org/about/people/d/dion-schwarz_cynthia.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Cynthia Dion-Schwarz</strong></a>, senior scientist at the RAND corporation.
