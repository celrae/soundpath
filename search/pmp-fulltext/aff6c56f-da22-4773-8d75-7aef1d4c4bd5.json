After he masters the agency's tactics, he goes home to the southside of Chicago on a mission to train street gangs to be \"Freedom Fighters.\" When a young man is shot dead by the police, Freeman's trainees spring into action. What happens in the end is open to interpretation, as you'll hear at the start of this recording of our panel discussion.</p><p>The members of our panel are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/africanacarr\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Greg Carr</a>, Chair of the Department of Afro-American Studies at Howard University, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamilahLemieux\" target=\"_blank\">Jamilah Lemieux</a>, Senior Editor at <em>Ebony Magazine</em>, and <a href=\"http://www.aaanet.org/sections/aba/author/nyerere/\" target=\"_blank\">K. Nyerere Ture</a>, an anthropologist and professor at Morgan State University.</p><p>The panel and the audience discussed the film's themes of resistance and intra-racial tension as well as the erasure of the Black Arts movement from mainstream discussion of black history. \"The villain of the film,\" said Dr. Carr, \"is the idea of the nation-state.\"</p><hr /><p><em>Special thanks:</em> <em>Erin McIntyre, Dennis Herndon, Keith Woods, Darlene Barkley, Justin Lucas, Brittany Brown, Neil Tevault, Bobby Carter, Eleanor Kagan, Morgan McCloy, Joe Hagen and Anya Grundmann.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
