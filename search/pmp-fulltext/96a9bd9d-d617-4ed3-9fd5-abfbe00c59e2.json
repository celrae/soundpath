LaNier spoke to thousands of North Central Wisconsin school children this week in appearances at Edgar High School, Wausau East High School and UW-Marathon County, through the acclaimed Walk in their Shoes lecture series. The program will feature an extended interview between LaNier and host Glen Moberg, audio gathered at the Edgar High School appearance, reaction from the high school students in attendance, and analysis by political scientist Eric Giordano of the Wisconsin Institute for Public Policy and Service. LaNier’s appearance was sponsored in part by Wisconsin Public Radio.","itags":["npr_api","385557112"],"contentencoded":"<p><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 MPX.
