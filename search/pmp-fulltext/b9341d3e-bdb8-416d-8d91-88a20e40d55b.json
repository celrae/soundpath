Mohammad Ali Allahdadi was killed while in Syria advising Syrian troops. Iran and Hezbollah have been supporting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against a mix of rebel opposition forces.</p><p>Israel doesn't usually comment officially on such strikes, though it's thought to have carried out others â€” the latest in early December. The Revolutionary Guard statement blamed \"Zionist\" forces. Reuters reported that an unnamed Israeli security source confirmed that Israel carried out the strike.</p><p>In addition to Iran's Allahdadi, six ranking members of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah were killed. One was Jihad Mughniyeh, son of the late high-ranking Hezbollah strategist Imad Mughniyeh. The elder Mughniyeh was killed in a 2008 bombing that Hezbollah blamed on Israel.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://syriahr.com/en/2015/01/11-military-leaders-from-militia-of-hezbollah-and-the-iranian-revolutionary-guards-die-over-the-last-24-hours/\">Syrian Observatory for Human Rights</a>, which tracks violence in Syria through a network of local sources, says a house and two cars were hit in the Quneitra region, near the border with Israel.</p><p>Both Hezbollah and Iran reacted angrily. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif condemned the strike as a terrorist attack.</p><p>Just last week in a televised interview, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned Israel not to underestimate the group's military might.</p><p>Lebanese analyst Hilal Khashan says the airstrike early Sunday is a blow to Hezbollah because of the \"significant\" figures killed. But he said that recent attacks by Israel have not drawn major military responses from Hezbollah.</p><p>The fact that Hezbollah is stretched thin now as it's engaged in the war in Syria, Khashan said, could reduce the chances it would want to open a new battle with Israel.</p><p>But other analysts were reported saying the group might feel it has to respond to avoid looking weak; Lebanese media quoted unnamed Hezbollah officials saying the group was looking for a calculated response.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
