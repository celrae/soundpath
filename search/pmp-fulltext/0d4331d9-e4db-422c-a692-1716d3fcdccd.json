The ship-tracking software was described in Chris Joyce's piece <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2015/02/05/383562379/gotcha-satellites-help-strip-seafood-pirates-of-their-booty\">on illegal fishing</a>. It was developed by John Amos of SkyTruth (the aforementioned \"gentleman in West Virginia\") and Google, using ships' automatic identification system, or AIS.</p><p>Jimmie Meyer in Sealy, Texas, had the same thought. \"Seems the AIS does a great job in tracking ships,\" he wrote. \"Why can't the AIS be used in tracking the aircraft?\"</p><p>Good question!</p><p>To sort it out, we headed down the hall to talk to the Science Desk's physics guy, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/people/279612138/geoff-brumfiel\">Geoff Brumfiel</a>.</p><p>He explained that not only <em>can</em> we track ships and planes in the same way, but in many cases we actually already do. AIS tracks just ships, but there's another company — <a href=\"http://www.inmarsat.com/\">Inmarsat</a> — that provides tracking for both ships and planes.</p><p>\"[Inmarsat] used to stand for International Maritime Satellite Organization,\" Brumfiel says. \"This was a company set up in 1979 originally as a nonprofit to track only ships. Today almost all of the world's airplanes are tracked by the same company.\"</p><p>So, then, why aren't we tracking planes in real time?</p><p>\"Although Inmarsat provides that service, you have to pay for it,\" Brumfiel explains. \"Kind of like you have to pay for a cable subscription even if you own a cable box.</p><p>\"A lot of carriers pay for the service and they transmit their position data. But Malaysia Airlines was one of the carriers that didn't. And as a result, the position data from this missing plane — Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 — was never sent.\"</p><p>What's on the table now in the world of airline tracking is new regulations: \"Regulations that would require this information to be sent — it would no longer be an option for the company,\" he explains.</p><p>While the new airline tracking regulations <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/02/05/383963482/new-standards-for-tracking-aircraft-in-flight\">get hammered out</a>, \"Inmarsat has already said they're willing to offer to take data from the airplane — the position data — <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27369288\">for free</a>, and process that at no cost,\" Brumfiel says.</p><p>\"So there's really very few barriers at this point\" to universal plane tracking, he continues. \"The antennas are in place, Inmarsat's willing to do it, it may become a regulation shortly — I think we're likely to see tracking very soon.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
