If you came of age a generation ago, your Batman of choice was likely to have been the big-screen caped crusader played by Michael Keaton or George Clooney. Or maybe even Val Kilmer.</p><p>But between 1966 and 1968, long before any of those versions of the DC Comics hero, Batman came to the screen in a much lighter, and brighter, ABC series, starring Adam West. <em>The Dark Knight </em>it wasn't. This <em>Batman </em>was played for laughs, with its star's no-nonsense delivery making it all the more tongue-in-cheek.</p><p>With its pop-art sensibility, vibrant colors and rogue's gallery of playful guest stars, <em>Batman </em>was a brief but major hit. Frank Gorshin as the Riddler, Cesar Romero as the Joker, Burgess Meredith as the Penguin and Julie Newmar as Catwoman — these were some of the original villains who made this <em>Batman </em>a TV phenomenon right from the start. That first season, ABC presented two episodes per week in a serialized cliffhanger format — and both installments made that year's Top 10.</p><p>Yet, until now, this particular incarnation of <em>Batman </em>has never been released on home video — not on DVD, not even on VHS. But Warner Bros. Home Video has just released the entire Adam West <em>Batman </em>series on DVD and Blu-ray, including a limited-edition collectible box set that comes with a set of <em>Batman </em>trading cards and even a Hot Wheels Batmobile. Some collectors, I guess, will geek out over all that extra stuff — but personally, I love the extras that come on the bonus disc, like the original screen test of Burt Ward, who won the role of Robin, and the original pilot for a planned <em>Batgirl </em>spinoff, and a new documentary, which has various Batman experts placing the TV series squarely in the pop-art movement of the mid '60s.</p><p>Most of all, of course, I love these old <em>Batman </em>episodes themselves. Certainly, that goes for the classics, like the ones with the original Catwoman, and those pop-art fight scenes.</p><p>But, to be honest, I also enjoy watching the really obscure, justifiably forgotten, admittedly bad ones. Who remembers Zsa Zsa Gabor as Minerva, or Ida Lupino as Dr. Cassandra? <em>I </em>didn't. But I <em>do </em>remember Joan Collins, in a pre-<em>Dynasty </em>role at her most alluring, playing the seductive villainess known as the Siren. Her high-pitched, miniskirted spell worked well, and not just on Commissioner Gordon.</p><p>I remember the Siren, and especially Catwoman, very fondly indeed. Various rights issues have kept <em>Batman </em>from home-video release until now, so younger viewers — those seeing this goofy, playful comic-book TV version for the first time — may be very pleasantly surprised by the fun to be had here. And for fans of a certain age, who are old enough to remember the '60s, I'm fairly certain this long-delayed box set will be worth the wait. Holy sensory overload, Batman!</p><p><em>David Bianculli is founder and editor of the website </em><a href=\"http://www.tvworthwatching.com/\">TV Worth Watching</a>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
