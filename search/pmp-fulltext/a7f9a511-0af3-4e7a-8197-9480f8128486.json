Almost 13 years ago, Bennett was one of many homebuyers who bet big on places they thought were on the way up. In fact, the inside of Bennett’s 2,000-square-foot, five-bedroom home in Englewood on the South Side of Chicago is something to behold. The place is decorated with beautiful paintings, leather couches, hardwood floors and granite countertops. But it’s another story when you look outside his back window.\n<p>“This house right here?” Bennett says, pointing out his kitchen window to a distressed property across the alley. “Board up to right, board up to the left. So, that’s three we’re looking at right outside the window.”</p>\n<p>In fact, abandoned houses and empty lots line the streets around Bennett's home. When he bought the two-story frame house in 2000, he was betting that Englewood was about to make a dramatic comeback. He'd seen it happen in other <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/12/how-black-gentrifiers-have-affected-perception-chicagos-changing-neighborhoods/4233/\">historically black neighborhoods on the South Side</a>.</p>\n<p>“I was looking for a neighborhood that I thought was going to be the next Bronzeville,” he says. “And obviously that unfortunately has not really happened.”</p>\n<p>Bennett bet wrong on gentrification. Instead of coming up, Englewood's been spiraling down. <a href=\"http://www.trulia.com/real_estate/Englewood-Chicago/2905/\">Home prices are off over 50 percent</a> from five years ago. And the neighborhood has one of the <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/guns-and-dollars/economic-breakdown-chicagos-englewood-neighborhood\">highest murder rates in the city</a>.</p>\n<p>“If I had it to do all over again,” Bennett says. “No. To be honest with you, I would not have moved here.”</p>\n<p>But neither is he willing to sell the home for pennies on the dollar. “I’m not just going to give my house away,” he says.</p>\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"122031\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":397,\"width\":600,\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"media-element\"}}]]</p>\n<p><em>Bennett serves loose-leaf tea in his kitchen</em></p>\nCritics of gentrification say people like Bob Bennett push poor residents out.
