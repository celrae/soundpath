We intuited, for example, that Adele was about to become a dominant force shortly after she <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/133687905/adele-tiny-desk-concert\">breezed into our offices</a>. (Okay, that didn't exactly require psychic powers, but still.) In the case of Johnnyswim, the prevailing sense boiled down to, \"Boy, we haven't heard the last of <em>them</em>.\"</p><p>Impossibly telegenic and charming, husband and wife Abner Ramirez and Amanda Sudano — who formed their band in Nashville before relocating to L.A. — have the booming voices of great street buskers, but also the polished sparkle of natural-born stage performers. Sudano is the daughter of the late <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/search/index.php?searchinput=donna+summer\">Donna Summer</a>, with whom she used to sing backup, but Johnnyswim's story isn't one of nepotism or overnight success; the two have been at this together for nearly a decade, and they've got the grandiose impeccability to prove it.</p><p>In this set, the lovely ballad \"Falling for Me\" is bookended by songs that could be airdropped onto half the shows on television; if you're hearing them here for the first time, don't be surprised if it's your first exposure of many. Johnnyswim opens this session with \"Home\" — a sweet rouser that could easily follow in the footsteps of other recent hits with that title — and closes it with a full-band reading of what promises to be its signature song, the title track from the new <em>Diamonds</em>. As Sudano notes here, the song has morphed into \"an anthem to ourselves to keep ourselves encouraged.\" For Johnnyswim, such pep talks won't likely be necessary for long.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"Home\"</li><li>\"Falling For Me\"</li><li>\"Diamonds\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Faith Masi, Olivia Merrion; photo by Jim Tuttle/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
