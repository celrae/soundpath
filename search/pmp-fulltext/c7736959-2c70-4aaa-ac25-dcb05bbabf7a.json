And the volatility is a function of the fact that states have become increasingly dependent of people at the very top end, that get a lot of their income from investments in the financial markets. And as we know those can go through a lot of fluctuation and turmoil, and that translates directly to state budgets in the form of revenue volatility.</p><p>&#8220;And really that&#8217;s a very challenging problem for states when it comes to setting their annual budgets.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On what states can do to address income inequality</strong></p><p>&#8220;States with higher levels of education have shown less income inequality, so one strategy for a state might be to pursue an objective of raising the overall education level throughout that state.</p><p>&#8220;Now that would take a long time, you&#8217;re talking about a generational type of change. But at the same time, this problem that we&#8217;re discussing has been a long time in the making. So however they approach it, we think it&#8217;s unlikely it will change anytime in the near future.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.bondbuyer.com/authors/gabriel-petek-552.html?csite=calpub12\">Gabriel Petek</a>, </strong>senior director of U.S. Public Finance, State and Local Government at Standard & Poor&#8217;s.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
