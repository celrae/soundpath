So they always imagine a beautiful image of their home back in Syria.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Hasan Ahmad</strong>, a 13 year-old resident, has lived in the camp for three years.</p><p>When asked what the biggest difference is between his life in Syria and his life now, Hasan says he used to be happier.</p><ul><li><strong>Mercy Corps:</strong><a href=\"https://www.mercycorps.org/photoessays/jordan-syria/life-zaatari-inside-look\" target=\"_blank\"> Life in Za&#8217;atari: An inside look</a></li></ul><h4>Interview Highlights</h4><p><strong>On the conditions at the camp</strong></p><p>&#8220;The conditions are not great, but comparing to what they were to when the camp opened, it&#8217;s getting better.</p><p>&#8220;80 percent of them are living in prefabs, and around 20 percent of them are living in tents.</p><p>&#8220;If you look down the main street of the camp, it&#8217;s packed with people. There are a lot of shops on each side of the road. All kinds of stuff. It&#8217;s crowded. It&#8217;s too much. But it&#8217;s full of life here.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;The only way they can leave the camp is they have a Jordanian family to bail them out. Bail them out means that the Jordanian family needs to take responsibility, that this family is coming under their risk and under their name. So one way of leaving the camp is to be bailed out, to live in the Jordanian city. The other way is if you apply to go back to Syria.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On what it is like to be a kid</strong></p><p>&#8220;The new kids who come, they come traumatized and they come with a lot of stress.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;A lot of them are going to school &#8212; there are schools inside the camps and schools outside the camps that Syrians can go to for free. However a good portion of kids prefer to work and make some money rather than going and spending time in school.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Especially when they are in the teenager stage, they tend to be more harsh &#8230; more able to cope with different living conditions. Their dreams are different. Their hopes are different. Talking to kids here in the camp, asking them, &#8216;What are looking for, what&#8217;s your hope?&#8217; and most of them go, &#8216;We wish and we dream about going back to Syria.'&#8221;</p><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><strong>Raed Nimri</strong>, deputy country director for <a href=\"http://www.mercycorps.org/jordan\" target=\"_blank\">Mercy Corps</a> in Jordan.</li><li><strong>Hasan Ahmad</strong>, a 13 year-old resident of Za&#8217;atari.</li></ul><h4><strong>Related</strong></h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/12/03/photographer-syria-portraits\">Photographer Hopes To Put Face On Syrian Statistics</a></li><li><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2015/01/06/syrian-refugees-challenges\">Syrian Refugees Face New Challenges</a></li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
