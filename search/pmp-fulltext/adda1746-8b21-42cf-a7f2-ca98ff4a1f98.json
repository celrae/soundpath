Having seen her mostly with a big and powerful band, I wondered if this configuration would work. But it was magic, with the trombone poignantly complementing her mellifluous voice and stark personal words.</p><p>Zola Jesus is the work of Nika Roza Danilova. She has five albums that span and mix electronic music, classical and goth influences. She's always exploring unusual combinations, and this mix of trombone and voice provides just a glimpse into her eclectic explorations. If you find this intriguing and don't know Zola Jesus, you're in for an adventure as you explore her catalog, including her most recent album, <em>Taiga.</em></p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"Ego\"</li><li>\"Hunger\"</li><li>\"Nail\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Maggie Starbard; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Colin Marshall, Maggie Starbard; Assistant Producer: Michaela Gugliotta; photo by <em>Colin Marshall</em>/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
