She's been a child gospel singer, a '70s Southern soul hit-maker and then a disco queen. Six decades since she toured the gospel circuit with the Jewell Gospel Trio, Staton has released her 27th album, <em>Life Happens.</em> It includes songs tracked at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Ala., where she'd once recorded \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHI88EVBZzc\" target=\"_blank\">I'm Just a Prisoner</a>.\"</p><p>\"I look at this album as an anthology of my life,\" Staton says. \"Each song tells a story of some of things I've endured and gone through and come out smelling like a rose. I thank God for that.\"</p><p>She has endured. Staton recently spoke with NPR's Melissa Block about her struggle with alcoholism, her chance to meet <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15355551/mahalia-jackson\">Mahalia Jackson</a> as a young girl, and her personal philosophy: \"I'm always ready for anything that comes my way. I'm ready for it.\" Hear their conversation at the audio link.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
