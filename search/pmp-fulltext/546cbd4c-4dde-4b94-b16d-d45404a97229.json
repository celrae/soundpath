She is particularly interested in the influence of genetics on age-related diseases. Kenyon believes that science could pinpoint the molecules responsible for the onset of age-related diseases in humans, and prevent them. She is also the co-founder of a drug-development company called Elixir Pharmaceuticals.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
