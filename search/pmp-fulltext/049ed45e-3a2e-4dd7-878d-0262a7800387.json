The proposal cleared some big hurdles in Williams County planning and zoning committee meetings over the past few months.</span></p>\n<p><span>“If we were to try to time each stage of it with oil price fluctuations, we'd never get any place,” says Stropiq’s Terry Olin.</span></p>\n<p><span>When Stropiq announced the project last year, oil was trading at about $40 a barrel higher than it is today. And more than twice the current number of drilling rigs were operating in North Dakota — 185 compared to about 80 today.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Whatever price oil is, it’s temporary, high or low,” Olin says. “We're on one of 10 oil fields in history that's ever surpassed a million barrels a day. Technology is now to the point where we can access oil under the Bakken [formation], and&nbsp;we're not going to forget how.”</span></p>\n<p><span>A number of experts agree that the oil industry in North Dakota is poised to rebound — eventually. Among them is Elliot Eisenberg, a real estate economist. He says it’s not unreasonable to plan a big project in North Dakota’s Bakken right now, unless you believe oil prices will never rise.</span></p>\n<p><span>That said, he argues that developers today need a fair dose of patience, given the subdued outlook for oil.</span></p>\n<p><span>“Investors with very long time horizons might say, 'Look, labor costs are now lower, land prices are lower.

How many kids and spouses of oil field workers will settle in the area?</span></p>\n<p><span>That question has already vexed the school district. And it could thwart big mall projects like Stropiq's. So says Tom Rolfstad, Williston’s former director of economic development.&nbsp; He's generally upbeat about the town's future and thinks it's just going through a slowdown, not a full-on bust. But Rolfstad acknowledges retail needs permanent residents to thrive, and many oil field workers around Williston are temporary.</span></p>\n<p><span>“A lot of people rotate back somewhere else,” he says. “And they spend their money on their house back in whatever state they came from. So that maybe hurts us a little bit.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Even if the oil boom regains its steam and Williston attracts more workers who will throw down roots, Williams County Commissioner Dan Kalil may not rest easily.
