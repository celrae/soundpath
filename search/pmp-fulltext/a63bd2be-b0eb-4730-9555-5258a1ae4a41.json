Strangely enough, the enemies it is fighting are some of the main customers. That complicates the US goal of crippling the ISIS war machine.\r\n","contentencoded":"<p>ISIS has been described as the world&#39;s &quot;richest terrorist group,&quot; largely thanks to the oil fields it controls in Iraq and Syria. The militants likely generate more than $1 million in sales each day, and much of that oil is pumped in eastern Syria with the tacit approval of the group&#39;s ostensible enemy: the Assad regime.</p><p>&quot;It seems that this is going through brokers,&quot; says&nbsp;Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at Oklahoma University. &quot;In particular, one person who&#39;s been fingered is <a href=\"https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/commentaryanalysis/562681-minority-report\">a very prominent Christian businessman</a>&nbsp;close to the [Syrian] president who buys it, then arranges with the Syrian government to have it shipped back.&quot;</p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Western trade sanctions block imports of fuel into Syria. Landis says that has made the Assad regime reliant on oil that&#39;s either smuggled into the country or pumped inside Syria itself &mdash; which means dealing with ISIS.</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&quot;The Assad government has to run its war machine, it has to run its cities, it needs power,&quot; Landis says, and it can get its power from ISIS &quot;cheaply&quot; because ISIS controls much of the country&#39;s oil fields.</span></p><p>Syria isn&#39;t the only unlikely customer, he says. &quot;Turkey, the Kurds &mdash; everybody is buying cheap oil and smuggling it across their border. So the notion that you have clear allies working against ISIS, it&#39;s not the case.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s potential for current American airstrikes to destroy the black market oil trade and cut this important source of income for ISIS.&nbsp;&quot;We can easily take out the oil,&quot; Landis says. &quot;We can bomb ISIS tankers, we can bomb the oil wells. This would be very easy. They&#39;re sitting out in the desert where everyone could see them.&quot;</p><p>But that would be a last resort. &quot;[The US] may ask the neighbors to stop exporting it first, because it doesn&#39;t want to destroy all this infrastructure,&quot; he says. &quot;It will, of course, cause a lot of hardship to the civilian population, and I&#39;m not sure America is there yet.&quot;</p>","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/Blue_Jerry_Cans.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/bluejerrycansjpg"}]}
