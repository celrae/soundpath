Sure, there have been popular teams — the Yankees, the Dodgers, the Cowboys when they were America's team and not Jerry Jones' team, Notre Dame — but all those teams engendered almost as much hate as love.</p><p>But <em>everybody </em>loves the Spurs. You love the Spurs. I love the Spurs. Have you ever heard anyone criticize the Spurs? No! The good feeling about our Spurs — and, yes, they are <em>our </em>Spurs — is because they are certified to do everything right. The players are all gentlemen. They are never selfish. They play like a team. They win. Our Spurs are not greedy. They are nonpartisan. If only our Spurs were Congress.
