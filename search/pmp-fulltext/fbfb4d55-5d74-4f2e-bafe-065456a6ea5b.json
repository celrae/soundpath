Following are highlights of the conversation.</p><hr /><p><strong>On the CDC's response to the anthrax and bird flu incidents</strong></p><p>I've imposed a moratorium on transfer of all infectious or potentially infectious material out of all of our high containment labs until we trust but verify that they're changing their protocols. ... I've closed the individual labs associated with the two incidents and they won't reopen until we are certain that they can reopen safely. I've appointed a senior scientist to be the single point of accountability and we're going to work at every level of CDC to increase the culture of safety here.</p><p><strong>On how the CDC is working to improve the safety of its labs</strong></p><p>One of the things that we want to ensure in the strengthening of the culture of safety is that people understand that anytime there might be a problem — or there is a problem — report it, rather than try to figure it out first and then report it. CDC scientists are rightly famous around the world for being the top in the world in their field, and that same rigor that we've been applying to finding and stopping outbreaks — that's the rigor we are now applying to improving safety at CDC.</p><p><strong>On how the CDC currently regulates labs that work with dangerous pathogens</strong></p><p>Scientists don't regulate themselves. We currently have a <a href=\"http://www.selectagents.gov/index.html\">select agent</a> program run by both a separate division of CDC and the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. These two agencies ... oversee all entities that work with select agents. We make unannounced site visits; we have detailed reviews. We'll look at whether these incidents suggest that we should do other things in addition at those.</p><p><strong>On whether we should establish an independent oversight team to regulate CDC facilities</strong></p><p>We're certainly open to anything that will improve lab safety. One of the things that I will be doing this week is inviting an external advisory group that has no prior employment with CDC to ... look at what we are doing on lab safety and biosecurity and suggest any ways that we can improve that process.</p><p>One thing that all three of these incidents suggest is that we need to take a hard look at the risks and the benefits of the different types of research that are being done and make sure in every case that the benefits justify ... potential risks.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
