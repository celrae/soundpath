He also spent those years touring and recording with the Motown legend Smokey Robinson, who was a big influence on Ho&apos;s music, even on the pieces he wrote for on hold.

Scott Broetzmann is the president of Customer Care Measurement and Consulting, which asked 702 households to rate their on-hold experiences on a scale of zero to ten. Zero being deeply unsatisfying.<br /><br /> &quot;And on that zero to ten scale, playing music while you are on hold averages a score of 5.37 -- in effect a neutral score.
