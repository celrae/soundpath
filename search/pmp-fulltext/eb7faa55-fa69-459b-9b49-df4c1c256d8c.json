As expected, it&#8217;s also ending a bond purchase program that was intended to keep long-term rates low.</p><p>The Fed on Wednesday reiterated its plan to maintain its benchmark short-term rate near zero &#8220;for a considerable time.&#8221; Most economists predict that the Fed won&#8217;t raise that rate before mid-2015. The Fed&#8217;s benchmark rate affects the rates on many consumer and business loans.</p><p>In a statement ending a policy meeting, the Fed suggested that the job market, though still not back to normal, is strengthening. The statement drops a previous reference to &#8220;significant&#8221; in referring to an &#8220;underutilization&#8221; of available workers. Instead, the Fed said that the underutilization of labor resources is &#8220;gradually diminishing.&#8221; The Fed also said that labor market conditions had improved further with &#8220;solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate.&#8221;</p><p>The change indicates that the Fed believes the labor market, while not completely restored following the Great Recession, is at least in better shape. One of the Fed&#8217;s major goals is to achieve maximum employment, which it currently defines as an unemployment rate between 5.2 percent and 5.5 percent. The unemployment rate in September fell to 5.9 percent.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.mesirowfinancial.com/economics/swonk/\" target=\"_blank\">Diane Swonk</a></strong>, chief economist with <a href=\"http://www.mesirowfinancial.com/default.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">Mesirow Financial</a>.
