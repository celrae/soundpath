One way is to get them where they live -- on their phones. <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mindblownlabs/mindblown-life\">Mindblown Life</a> is a new mobile phone app. It's designed to help high school and college kids learn how to manage money by playing a game.

And when the interest rates began to rise, she could no longer afford to make the payments.
