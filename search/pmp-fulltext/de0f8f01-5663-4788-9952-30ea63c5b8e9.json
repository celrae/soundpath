Even before the earthquake, a lot of Nepalis were out of the country making a living somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Most of those Nepalis — who usually send money back home — are men. And that means many women in Nepal have had to deal with the disaster on their own. Journalist Purvi Thacker happened to be in Nepal last month when the earthquake hit.</p>\n<p>After the quake, Thacker met Priya Lama, who was providing aid on the ground while dealing with her own destroyed home and life.</p>\n<p>“She actually had saved [her] mom,” says Thacker. \"Their house crumbled in. They were in one of these old mud houses ... she went to rescue her mother who is very old and, in the process, she’d fractured her leg. Her mother escaped with just minor cuts and lacerations.”</p>\n<p>Thacker <a href=\"http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/05/01/after-earthquake-in-nepal-sanitary-menstruation-practices-at-risk/\">reported for The New York Times</a> on the challenges women were facing — everything from getting access to water and having sanitary napkins.</p>\n<p>“[Lama] was on her period and she didn’t have any clean water to clean the cloth that she was using.”</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-original_image\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/02_new_0.jpg?itok=caP5w5Vq\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Women wait in line for clean water.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Purvi Thacker</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Thacker says, in a lot of cases, the women are also raising children.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-original_image\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/03_new.jpg?itok=7KFBAqsB\" alt=\"\" /><span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Purvi Thacker</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>New mothers and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable. </p>\n<p>It's been reported that one of the big post-disaster problems — specifically in this part of the world — <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/05/nepal-quake-survivors-face-threat-from-human-traffickers-supplying-sex-trade\">is the sex-trafficking industry preying on vulnerable women</a>. </p>\n<p>“There are a lot of NGOs that have expressed concern that this would lead to trafficking because, on the India/Nepal border, there has been a lot of police deployed to make sure people aren’t taking advantage of kids and women in this situation,” Thacker says.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-original_image\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/04_new_0.jpg?itok=nUS2Cpa1\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Destroyed homes in Nepal.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Purvi Thacker</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Many Nepali men have travelled home to help out their families.</p>\n<p>“I met groups of guys [at the airport] who were working in the service industry and in the hospitality industry in Saudi Arabia.
