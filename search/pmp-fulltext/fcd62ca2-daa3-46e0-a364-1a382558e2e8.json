We meet a variety of weird characters that give the city its countercultural feel. We also hear about the origins and evolution of &ldquo;weird&rdquo; in Austin, to help set the scene. Josh Long, author of &ldquo;Weird City: Sense of Place and Creative Resistance in Austin&rdquo; helps us out&hellip; As does Eddie Wilson, founder of the famed Austin club Armadillo World Headquarters.

One of the city&rsquo;s biggest strips of music clubs&mdash;Red River&mdash;is adjacent to a fancy condo development that club owners are worried could threaten the beloved gritty night scene and culture. And, as the cost of living in an increasingly popular spot has risen over the past decade, the pay for most local musicians has stayed the same, or gotten lower.

A Trailer Park Movement: Back in 2006, Michael Rypka wanted to open a restaurant, but didn&rsquo;t have enough cash on hand to do it. So, he bought an airstream trailer and turned it into a taco stand, called Torchy&rsquo;s Tacos, and parked it on South Congress Street. Lots of people came, and soon, others were opening up trailer-based restaurants. Hey Cupcake parked near Torchy&rsquo;s Tacos, and it inspired Josh Frank to open TREAT, which sells s&rsquo;mores kits from a trailer, with a little propane campfire set up out front, so you can toast your own marshmallows. Soon, hundreds of trailers were opening up in hubs around town, with good trailer eateries trying to recruit other good ones to park near them, to make their area a food destination. And that gave Josh Frank an idea: an official (restaurant) trailer park. He just opened EAT, which stands for East Austin Trailer Eatery. It turned a vacant lot into a restaurant trailer park, linked to a big (formerly) abandoned building that he&rsquo;s turned into an arts complex, with studios for rent to local artists&hellip; And the trailer culture is even catching on with the non-edible world&hellip; It also may be the new face of entrepreneurship in general. Chad Swisher had worked in ad agencies for years, and wanted to open up his own shop, but couldn&rsquo;t afford the office space.
