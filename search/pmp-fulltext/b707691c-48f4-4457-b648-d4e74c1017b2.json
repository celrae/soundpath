It comes after his 1966 album <em>Blonde On Blonde,</em> a work filled with raucous, rocking, stream-of-conscious imagery. About 18 months later, Dylan returned to his earlier style of acoustic music on <em>John Wesley Harding</em>. What accounted for that gap, and what transpired during it, are still a subject of speculation among those who care about such things. In any case, around the time of a motorcyle accident, Dylan retreated from public view.</p><p>Out of that time came a collection of songs referred to as <em>The Basement Tapes</em>. Those songs would be released in 1975 â€” but the story of the gap goes deeper.</p><p>Last fall, producer and musician <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15171857/t-bone-burnett\" target=\"_blank\">T Bone Burnett</a> received a phone call from <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15193203/bob-dylan\" target=\"_blank\">Bob Dylan</a>'s publisher. It had uncovered a box of lyrics from 1967, songs that had Dylan had never put to music, and wanted to know whether Burnett was interested in doing something with them.</p><p>\"There was such a depth to the material. It was nothing I wanted to attempt myself,\" Burnett says in a conversation with NPR's Robert Siegel. \"At the time, Bob was collaborating with one of the most extraordinary groups of musicians in history, the group that came to be known as <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15184415/the-band\" target=\"_blank\">The Band</a>. I thought, in keeping with that spirit of collaboration that Bob was engendering at that time, let's do the same thing. Let's find a group of bandleaders who know how to collaborate, and could come in and conjure something up out of these lyrics.\"</p><p>That star-studded group Burnett assembled includes <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15045892/elvis-costello\" target=\"_blank\">Elvis Costello</a>, contemporary folk notables Marcus Mumford of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/101141614/mumford-and-sons\" target=\"_blank\">Mumford & Sons</a> and Taylor Goldsmith of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/113932444/dawes\" target=\"_blank\">Dawes</a>, vocalist Rhiannon Giddens of the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/99046725/carolina-chocolate-drops\" target=\"_blank\">Carolina Chocolate Drops</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15189632/my-morning-jacket\" target=\"_blank\">My Morning Jacket</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/91719097/jim-james\" target=\"_blank\">Jim James</a>. The group's debut album together is titled <em>Lost on the River: The New Basement Tapes.</em></p><p>Burnett says the task of putting music to Dylan's words was daunting, and yet compelling: Here was a chance to get into the songwriter's mind at a time when he was arguably <em>too</em> productive.</p><p>\"It's irresistible to get to collaborate with a 27-year-old Bob Dylan,\" Burnett says. \"We felt maybe we could catch up with him at this point.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
