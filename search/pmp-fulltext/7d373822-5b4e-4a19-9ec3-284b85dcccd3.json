Today, more than 6,000 players pay the $10,000 entrance fee for the No-Limit Texas Hold 'em Tournament. ESPN televises the final table, and last year the winner took home more than $8 million in prize money.</p><p>Novelist Colson Whitehead was a decent amateur card player when <em>Grantland</em> made him an offer: They'd pay his $10,000 entrance fee if he'd spend a few weeks training, then enter the World Series of Poker and <a href=\"http://grantland.com/features/part-1/\">write about it for them</a>. The result is Whitehead's new book, <em>The Noble Hustle: Poker, Beef Jerky and Death</em>, a sharp observational tale of the game, those who play it and how his experience in the big show changed him.</p><p>Whitehead is a past recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship. His other books include <em>Sag Harbor</em> and <em>Zone One</em>.
