But around Christmas, people around the world covet a Rudolph, Wis., postmark on their cards and letters.</p><p>\"The stamp actually says 'Rudolph, Wisconsin, Home of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,' \" says Becky Trzebiatowski, the town's postmaster. It's her job to rubber-stamp each piece of mail with an illustration of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.</p><p>\"People send their Christmas cards in an envelope with a note that says, 'Can you please postmark this and send it out?' \" she says.</p><p>The tradition started in 1945 and really took off after the animated television special <em>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</em> aired in 1964. And things really got crazy <em>this</em> year because it's the 50th anniversary of that special.</p><p>\"Normally this little post office would send out maybe two trays of mail, you know, about maybe 1,000 pieces. This year we sent out 36 trays of mail,\" Trzebiatowski says.</p><p>Rudolph, Wis., was not named after the reindeer, by the way. The name honors Rudolph Hecox, the first child born in the town, in the 1850s — but that hasn't stopped Rudolph from going head-over-antlers for its red-nosed namesake.</p><p>\"We incorporate some fireworks and a lighted parade, and Christmas here in Rudolph is really a very delightful little town to be in,\" Trzebiatowski says.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
