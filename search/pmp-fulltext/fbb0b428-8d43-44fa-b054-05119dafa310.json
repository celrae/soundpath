The losses have forced Russia to spend $6 billion this month to shore up the ruble, and analysts say if oil continues to remain cheap, Russia will be forced to draw money from its sovereign funds to make up budget deficits.</p><p>Top Russian officials believe that the price drop is a deliberate U.S. act to weaken their country, as seen in a Pravda headline: &#8220;Obama Wants Saudi Arabia To Destroy Russian Economy.&#8221;</p><p>Russia expert <strong>Edward Lucas</strong> told <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org\"><em>Here & Now&#8217;</em></a>s Jeremy Hobson that the price drop is actually the result of market forces, but he says that &#8220;it is true that West did force the oil price down in the 1980s with the help of Saudis,&#8221; which weakened the Soviet Union.</p><p>However, Lucas says neither the drop in oil prices nor Western sanctions are going to make Putin back down.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/mediadirectory/edward-lucas\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Edward Lucas</strong></a>, senior editor at <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Economist</a>, and author of the just re-released, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Cold-War-Putins/dp/0230614345/?tag=wburorg-20\" target=\"_blank\">The New Cold War: Putin&#8217;s Russia and the Threat to the West</a>.&#8221; He tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edwardlucas\">@edwardlucas</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
