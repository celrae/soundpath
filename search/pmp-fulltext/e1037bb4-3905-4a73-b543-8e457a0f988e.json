In 2010, <a href=\"http://wavesoffreedom.org/marion-poizeau/\">Marion Poizeau</a> first visited the coastal area of Baluchistan/Chabahar, an Iranian province on the Persian Gulf near the Pakistani border. Her 2013 documentary, \"<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/intothesea\">Into the Sea</a>,\" tells the story of how surfing took hold in the region, and how they and Iranian sportswomen collaborated on the effort to make that happen.</p>\n<p>Poizeau and Irish surfer Easkey Briton first went to Iran in 2010. Before arriving, a search on Facebook led them to Iranians Mona Seraji, a snowboard instructor, and Shalha Yasini, a swimmer. Seraji and Yasini joined them and became advocates for the sport in their homeland.</p>\n<p>\"They are ambassadors for sure, they were amazing. It's teamwork. Because we were this group, it worked,\" Poizeau says.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/110750116\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Into The Sea - Trailer\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Poizeau says it can always be challenging to introduce something new to a country/culture, but Iran has embraced the sport. Poizeau says two things made the effort a success: the waves and the hospitality. </p>\n<p>\"We have the support of the local community and the support of the religious [leaders] there,\" she says. \"The people are very, very welcoming. There's a great potential because a lot of people want to make it happen.\" </p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_align-right cta_border\" data-entity-id=\"81887\" data-entity-title=\"Learn more surfing ngos\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-81887\" class=\"node node-story-act story-act-cta story-act-nid-81887 cta-type-custom-text clearfix\" about=\"/node/81887\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/81887\">Learn more surfing ngos</a></h2>\n<p>    <span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Learn more surfing ngos\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    Learn more   </div>\n<div class=\"field-body\">\n<p>Intrigued by surfing as development around the world?</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WavesforChange/photos/pb.212569272204776.-2207520000.1434646525./695396307255401/?type=3&amp;theater\">Waves For Change</a> in South Africa, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/surfaid/photos_stream\">SurfAid</a> in Southeast Asia and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/altoperusurf\">Alto Perú</a> in Peru for more information.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>People were welcoming, but they were surprised, Poizeau says. They had never seen surfing before. \"Because we were only women in the water, they thought it was a sport for women,\" she says. \"So the men asked us if they could also do it.\"</p>\n<p>One challenge, however, was the clothing. Standard surf-wear doesn't leave much room for modesty, so it was difficult for the Iranian women to find clothing that was both water-friendly and culturally appropriate. The women wore makeshift covers on their heads, even donning heavy canvas ponchos. Now, Poizeau says, she's teaming up with a French-Iranian designer to design wetsuits tailored to the cultural requirements.</p>\n<p>What's next? \"We really want to have a surf school on the beach,\" Poizeau says. \"It's the most unpredictable project I have ever done, but I wish people are coming and enjoying the time as much as I enjoy when I go there.\"</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-06-10%2Fsurfing-desert&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/06182015_08.mp3"},{"href":"http://admin.pri.org/file/0618201508mp3"}]}
