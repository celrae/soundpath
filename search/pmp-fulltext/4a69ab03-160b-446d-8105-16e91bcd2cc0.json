There's a group of passionate bagpipe campaigners on a quest to show there's more to the pipes than playing on the heath in a kilt.","contentencoded":"<p>When you think of bagpipes, you probably think of Scotland, right? <em>Maybe</em> Ireland? Think again.</p>\n<p>\"They're all over Europe, from India to Ireland, to any country you can think of in between: Bulgaria, Belarus, Germany, Sweden, Spain, Italy, Croatia and Turkey — all these countries have local, indigenous bagpipes,\" says Cassandre Balosso-Bardin, a musicologist from London who also plays Galician bagpipes. </p>\n<p>And since March 10 is International Bagpipe Day, she and other pipe enthusiasts are trying to show off that diversity of styles and sounds.</p>\n<p>\"There's a whole wide world of mysterious bagpipes out there,\" Balosso-Bardin says. </p>\n<p>In Bulgaria, for instance, the bagpipe is a national instrument; the country has a national orchestra that features 100 bagpipes. And in Poland, she says, \"you can find bagpipes that sometimes feature carvings of goats' heads in wood on the melodic pipe.\"</p>\n<p>In Galicia, the northern Spanish region that's home to Balosso-Bardin's pipes, \"it's [a] very happy instrument and there are a few bagpipe superstars ... <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susana_Seivane\" title=\"Susana Seivane\">Susana Seivane</a> is one, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez_Mu%C3%B1oz\" title=\"Carlos Núñez Muñoz\">Carlos Núñez</a> is another.\"</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/0eGkJ8MfFXw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Balosso-Bardin says she's drawn to the Galician pipes, or <em>gaita, </em>because \"as soon as you hear them you know that there's a party going on somewhere. If you hear the Galician bagpipes, you can expect drummers, people playing seashells [another Galician tradition,] people singing, and you can expect traditional food and people dancing spontaneously.\"</p>\n<p>So what's behind International Bagpipe Day, and is it boosting worldwide appreciation of the instrument?</p>\n<p>According to Balosso-Bardin, the idea of celebrating the world's diverse bagpipe traditions only got underway five years ago, thanks to the UK's <a href=\"http://www.bagpipesociety.org.uk\">Bagpipe Society</a>. Now there's <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/internationaldayofthebagpipe/timeline\">the holiday</a>, and a biennial international bagpipe conference for scholars and musicologists is scheduled for 2016 at the <a href=\"http://www.thepipingcentre.co.uk/news\">National Piping Center in Glasgow</a>.</p>\n<p>There's surely more to say about bagpipes, but I'd just be droning on.</p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-03-10%2Fhold-your-hats-today-international-bagpipe-day&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/pipers.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/pipersmp3"}]}
