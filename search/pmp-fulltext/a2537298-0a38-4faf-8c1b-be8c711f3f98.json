(Details <a href=\"http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2014/11/17/40359/the-true-story-of-foxcatcher-mark-schultz-remember/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>; to the degree history can be a spoiler, that is one.) We sat down this week to talk about the film with our pal, NPR film critic Bob Mondello. We discuss how the film tries to be true despite departing substantially from real events, how Channing Tatum has developed through modeling and dancing into comedy and drama (and I talk about <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/channing-tatum-magic-mike-xxl-746565\" target=\"_blank\">a video</a> that shows off some of his skills), and how Steve Carell deploys his particular mix of goofy and sad.</p><p>After that, we move on to a topic near and dear to the hearts of everyone who's ever sat through the 20 minutes of hooey before a movie starts: trailers. From the director's-chair-introduction phase through \"in a world\" through to the arty trailers we know now, the business of teasing and tantalizing has responded to the sharing culture just like everything else, but where are we now?</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about giving a hat-tip to an old friend, and about <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2014/11/18/364975422/masterchef-junior-the-secret-ingredients-are-moppets-and-empathy\" target=\"_blank\">a show</a> I also wrote about recently. Glen is happy about a <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/channels/highmaintenance\" target=\"_blank\">web series</a> he promises is better than its premises and <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2014/08/why_is_jon_favreau_s_chef_the_indie_hit_of_the_summer.html\" target=\"_blank\">a film</a> that he calls a \"puppy dog.\" Bob is simply happy about the ability to talk about the films he saw in Toronto that haven't seen the light of day until recently. And I am happy about a <a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_550_-_allie_brosh\" target=\"_blank\">terrific interview</a> and a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/11/emojis-rapid-evolution.html\" target=\"_blank\">thoughtful examination</a> of little smiles and pictures of clapping.</p><p>Find us <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pchh\" target=\"_blank\">on Facebook</a> or follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nprmonkeysee\" target=\"_blank\">me</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/idislikestephen\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ghweldon\" target=\"_blank\">Glen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/bob_mondello\" target=\"_blank\">Bob</a>, producer <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jessica_reedy\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica</a>, and pal and producer emeritus <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/mikekatzif\" target=\"_blank\">Mike</a>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
