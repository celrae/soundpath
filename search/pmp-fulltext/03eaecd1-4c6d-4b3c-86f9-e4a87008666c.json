NPR’s <strong>Ari Shapiro</strong> has been speaking with voters in London, and tells <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young that there&#8217;s a sense of relief that a complicated election season is coming to a close.</p><p>Shapiro also talks about how this election is very different from those in years past because this year, fringe parties have given the two major parties &#8211; the Labour party and the Tory party &#8211; a run for their money. The prediction is that the results will be a hung parliament. In other words, no party will secure a majority vote, and the process could drag on.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/people/2101154/ari-shapiro\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Ari Shapiro</strong></a>, international correspondent for NPR.
