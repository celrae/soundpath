It's hugely popular here, dubbed over as <a href=\"http://www.canalplus.es/juego-tronos/\">Juego de Tronos</a>. Fans are flocking to <a href=\"http://www.zicasso.com/luxury-vacation-spain-tours/game-thrones-spain-tour-season-5\">Game of Thrones-themed tours</a> of Spain, and they're also looking for plot parallels in real-life Spanish politics.</p><p>HBO got unprecedented access to the country to shoot the show's fifth season in Seville's ancient Moorish palace, <a href=\"http://www.alcazarsevilla.org/\">the Alcázar</a>, for about a month last fall. It may or may not be a coincidence that the <a href=\"http://madrid.usembassy.gov/about-us/ambassador.html\">U.S. ambassador to Spain, James Costos</a>, is a former HBO executive.</p><p>The Alcazar was transformed into the <a href=\"http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Water_Gardens\">Water Gardens palace </a>in the mythical kingdom of Dorne, where Prince Doran Martell resides.</p><p>\"When we go into the gardens, they say, 'Ah, this is the Water Gardens!' \" observes <a href=\"http://sevillabypepe.com/\">Pepe Pallarés</a>, a licensed tour guide in Seville who has added a <em>Game of Thrones</em>-themed tour to his itinerary. \"For fans, it's like an amazing experience.\"</p><p>Seville's Alcázar has seen a 25 percent jump in tourist visits this past year, in part because of <em>Game of Thrones</em> fans.</p><p>\"Everything looks really familiar — the architecture and what not,\" says Sam Dawson, a college student visiting Seville from Minnesota. \"I've traveled to a few of the other locations where they filmed, and it's got the exact same vibes.\"</p><p>More than 85,000 locals applied to be extras on the <em>Game of Thrones</em> set in Seville. Only 5,000 were accepted — and only a fraction ever appeared on TV. But people are so obsessed, they've started searching for parallels in real life.</p><p>\"You can see the fight between the different royal houses in <em>Game of Thrones</em> — and they're more or less the same as our politicians today,\" Pallarés says. \"They're fighting to keep their jobs inside city hall, inside the presidency, etc. It's the same!\"</p><p><em>Game of Thrones</em> analogies are most popular among supporters of Podemos — <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/01/28/382056541/anti-austerity-party-in-spain-gathers-support-over-the-past-year\">a new left-wing, grass-roots party</a> that hopes to wrest power from Spain's ruling conservatives in elections this fall. At a recent Podemos rally, activists dressed up as rival <em>Game of Thrones</em> characters — the queen Daenerys Targaryen and the incestuous Lannisters.</p><p>When the Podemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, met Spanish King Felipe VI in Brussels this spring, he defied royal protocol and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/15/game-of-thrones-gift-spanish-king-pablo-iglesias\">handed the king a gift</a> — a DVD box set of <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p><p>\"I told him it's a series he'll definitely like, if he wants to understand the political crisis in Spain,\" Iglesias told reporters afterward, with a wink.</p><p>Iglesias has promised to hold a referendum on getting rid of Spain's monarchy, if elected. And his new slogan is \"Winter is Coming\" — for those in power, at least. Iglesias even edited <a href=\"http://www.akal.com/libros/Ganar-o-morir/9788446040101\">a new book</a> entitled <em>To Win or To Die: Political Lessons from Game of Thrones</em>.</p><p>Several of his co-authors are Spanish political scientists who also love <em>Game of Thrones</em>. One chapter's author, Dani Irraberi, who teaches political philosophy at Madrid's Complutense University, compares the people-power of Podemos with Daenerys Targaryen, the mother of dragons.</p><p>\"She doesn't just free the slaves; she empowers them to free themselves,\" Irraberi says. \"And that's what we see with Podemos. It's a political movement that tries to empower citizens to stand up to their oppressors, the ruling class.\"</p><p>Conservative political commentators in Spain are jumping on the <em>Game of Thrones</em> bandwagon, too. Even if Spanish conservatives are compared to the Lannisters — some of whom number among the TV show's villains — that's not necessarily bad, says conservative commentator Ruben Herrero. It's realpolitik, he says.</p><p>\"From Podemos, they try to say, 'We're good, we're like Khaleesi [Daenerys Targaryen], in favor of justice for poor people.' But that's not true,\" Herrero says. \"For instance, the Lannisters are realists — classical realists. It's like, 'I don't mind the nature of my partners while in power.' \"</p><p>Herrero's favorite conservatives may lose that hold on power in Spanish elections this fall. But not before the sixth season of <em>Game of Thrones</em> starts shooting this summer — <a href=\"http://time.com/3907216/game-thrones-season-6-spain/\">in Spain once again</a>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
