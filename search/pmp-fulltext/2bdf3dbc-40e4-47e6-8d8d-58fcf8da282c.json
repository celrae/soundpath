I think everyone does.Would you see yourself more as a husband or a father? Whatever I’m doing! Everyone has multiple roles in their lives that they’re passionate about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Although it is interesting. When you came and read some of those stories for our radio show, which you did when it first came out, I was talking to you about this and you indicated this is something that you had wanted to do for a long time and had never done.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Yes, humorous essays.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>B.J. Novak:</strong> Specifically, if I were to say what I really see myself as, I think it’s really about having an idea and so desperately wanting to see the reaction to it. One of my friends suggested a title for “One More Thing” as “I Wish I Could Watch You Read This,” because I want to write things and then I want to bring it to people and see if they like it. So, this type of reading a story aloud is my sort of ultimate purpose, I think.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> You’re welcome.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> You want to be able to shush them if they don’t like it.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>B.J. Novak:</strong> Right, yeah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> So, our second question is, tell us something we don’t know.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>B.J. Novak:</strong> Oh, the most interesting fact I’ve ever heard – and I have not heard it confirmed since this one class in college – is that during the Cultural Revolution in China, very zealous communist students decided, in certain towns, that <em>red</em> stoplights should mean <em>go</em> because red was the communist color. There were so many traffic accidents as the word sort of got out haphazardly that eventually they had to abandon this. But I thought that was the most interesting. It’s still the most interesting fact I know that no other person has ever told me, “I already knew that.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Let’s just believe it.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>B.J. Novak:</strong> Yeah, it’s a great story, too, even if it’s not true. It just goes to show you, fill in the blank.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br /></div>","published":"2014-12-19T01:39:57+00:00","guid":"2bdf3dbc-40e4-47e6-8d8d-58fcf8da282c","teaser":"Thank you very much.
