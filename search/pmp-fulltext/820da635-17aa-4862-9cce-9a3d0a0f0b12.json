She decided to make wristbands — 1-inch-thick white silicon wristbands with TMAYD MIT written on them in black letters.</p><p>TMAYD stands for Tell Me About Your Day.</p><p>She says that simple phrase can open up interactions with anybody.</p><p>\"It's a good way to check in and it spans all different kinds of conversations — bad, good, embarrassing, something you've accomplished, something you hope to accomplish.\"</p><p>She used her own money to have 200 wristbands made and started handing them out in March.</p><p>\"When I was first giving them out I was standing in Lobby 7 at MIT, which is like this main artery of campus. And a lot of people were confused by TMAYD but that was kind of the point. I wanted them to wonder,\" she says.</p><p>The curiosity factor worked and by the next day she had hundreds of requests. She got a grant from the Student Activities Office to make more.</p><p>Now, 2,500 TMAYD wristbands are floating around the campus, which has around 4,500 undergrads.</p><p>Lloyd says she recently saw four or five dancers at a dance troupe show wearing the wristbands. \"[It] was not part of their costume and so they still wore it and it was very visible. So that was the goal — is to be able to look at somebody and be like, 'OK, that person cares about me.' \"</p><p>She says the bands she created have even been a good reminder for her.</p><p>\"I look at it and I think, 'OK I'm gonna stop what I'm doing now and go talk to that girl over there sitting alone, I haven't talked to her in a while,' \" Lloyd says. \"And I hope that other people do that ... A lot of my friends have told me that people they haven't talked to in months have come up to them and asked them how their days are.\"</p><p>Upperclassmen and grad students are donning the wristbands. And some faculty are displaying the bands around their classrooms.</p><p>In the fall, there will be wristbands waiting for the class of 2019.</p><p>\"It's gonna be a really good time being able to sort of hand the wristbands to them and give them a physical object that says, 'We care about you and you're welcome here,' \" Lloyd says.</p><p>She hopes the message spreads off of the MIT campus and even beyond the college realm.</p><p>\"I think ... someday this could be a national acronym that people see, and I would love that,\" she says.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
