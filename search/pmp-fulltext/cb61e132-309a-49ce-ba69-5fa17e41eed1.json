I don&#8217;t know whether there was a vote or what it was, but it takes nine out of 12 jurors to vote for an indictment. There could be an 8-to-4 vote in favor of an indictment and there would be no indictment, yet the way the prosecuting attorney has portrayed it is that there was a collective decision that there was insufficient evidence.&#8221;</p><p><p class=\"gmail_default\"><strong>On potential issues within the case</strong></p><p><p class=\"gmail_default\">&#8220;The grand jury had been together for several months and heard hundreds of cases, up to 50 a day. They were usually 5 or 10 minutes long, the presentation of the cases, and then they&#8217;d return an indictment. Our client, he or she, says that the Wilson investigation was very different in many ways and the witnesses for the target, Officer Wilson, you know, were not vigorously questioned were not cross-examined by the prosecutors, yet people who testified against him were cross-examined and their credibility was brought into doubt by prosecutors. So that was a different experience than the earlier grand jury cases and that&#8217;s something that they&#8217;d like to talk about.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.aclu-mo.org/about/staff/tony-rothert/\"><strong>Tony Rothert</strong></a>, legal director for the ACLU Missouri.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
