But, most of the time, business doesn't work that way.","itags":["npr_api","348975479"],"guid":"d32f42bd-8613-4860-a710-3d21ada1175b","contentencoded":"<p>When Matt Levine graduated from law school, he got a job at a fancy corporate law firm. Big office; long hours.</p><p>\"I remember going to sleep at like, you know 3 or 4 a.m. under my desk, which was not that unusual,\" says Levine. \"But I remember it because it was my birthday.\"</p><p>His firm was representing a small Midwestern chain in this one contract negotiation. Levine's job was to make sure the contract reflected all the tiny details.</p><p>After they closed the deal, Levine realized he'd made a mistake. The contract he had written said his clients should be paid $400 million for one part of the deal.</p><p>But an email he had overlooked — an email that had been sent during the negotiations — said his clients were supposed to get $425 million. He thought, \"Did I just cost my client $25 million?\"</p><p>He called the client to explain.</p><p>\"He paused for a minute,\" Levine says. \"And then he just started laughing uproariously. He said, 'Let me call them, I'll fix it.' And that was pretty much it.\"</p><p>Levine had always thought a contract was binding. Now he saw two big companies laugh off his little mistake. The other side agreed to revise the contract to pay the extra $25 million.</p><p>The whole experience surprised Levine. \"I thought it was a game,\" he says. \"You sort of score points. And they had scored this point through my fault, and they were going to get something for it.\"</p><p>Business may be a game, Levine realized, but it's not a one-time game. It's more like an infinite game. It's a game in which people have to live with each other, work with each other again, and perhaps, write another big contract.</p><p>The only time the words in a contract really matter, Levine says, is when things start to get ugly — like when people start suing each other. For example, he says, the casino giant Caesars is currently <a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-05-13/caesars-and-the-450-million-and\" target=\"_blank\">fighting a suit</a> by bondholders that may turn on the word \"and\" in a contract. Caesars insists the \"and\" should be interpreted as an \"or.\"</p><p>Levine imagines the contract was written by some 26-year-old kid who was sleeping under his desk and didn't give that \"and\" a second thought.</p><p><em>Update: <em>There was a typo in the original post --</em> the word \"word\" was misspelled as \"world.\" Thank you to the commenters for bringing it to our attention. </em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
