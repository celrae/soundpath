Most fans know Lanois as a remarkable producer for the likes of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15193203/bob-dylan\">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15816983/u2\">U2</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15401893/peter-gabriel\">Peter Gabriel</a>.</p><p>What Daniel Lanois brought to the Tiny Desk recalled that early work while still sounding new: He led an all-instrumental, somewhat improvisational trio based on the sort of studio processing for which he's become famous. In essence, he brought the studio out of the studio — with the aid of two great players, drummer <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/90467985/brian-blade\">Brian Blade</a> and bassist Jim Wilson — and directly to my desk. The title of Lanois' new album, <em>Flesh And Machine,</em> describes the music well. He never says a word, but he sculpts some serious, hypnotic sounds.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"Sci Fi\"</li><li>\"Elevator\"</li><li>\"Apres Calypso\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Maggie Starbard; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Colin Marshall, Maggie Starbard; Assistant Producer: Susan Hale Thomas; photo by Susan Hale Thomas/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
