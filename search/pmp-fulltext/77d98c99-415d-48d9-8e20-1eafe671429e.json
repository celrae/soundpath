Brendan Angelides introduced himself as a musician and friend of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/123604659/jonsi\">JÃ³nsi</a> and Alex Somers, who were hosting the party. When I came home from the Iceland Airwaves music festival, I listened to the music Angelides makes under the name <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/390498671/eskmo-mind-of-war\">Eskmo</a>, and was intrigued.</p><p>His current record, <em>SOL</em>, is mysterious, but I wondered how a Tiny Desk Concert would work, as buttons getting pushed and sliders sliding don't always make for a compelling performance.

Which is how plywood shelving from the Tiny Desk, water bottles and a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15158238/paul-mccartney\">Paul McCartney</a> doll head became percussion instruments in the hands of a man who's part musician, part magician.
