They&#8217;re run in Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin and New York. Shorter says those races should demand that any athlete who wants to compete should be part of a registered drug testing pool. Then an accredited anti-doping agency would test them regularly, ensuring fairness.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a privilege to be in these races, you don&#8217;t have a right to run in these races,&#8221; Shorter said, &#8220;and so you can require people to do certain things to run in your race.&#8221;</p><p>Kenya&#8217;s athletics federation will hold a hearing on Jeptoo&#8217;s case in January. The first major marathon of the year will be run in Tokyo on February 22, 2015.</p><p><em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here and Now</a></em>&#8216;s &#8220;Marathon Man&#8221; <strong>Alex Ashlock</strong> reports.</p><h4>Reporter</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/about/people/alex-ashlock\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Ashlock</a></strong>, producer and director at <em>Here & Now</em>.
