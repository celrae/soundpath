She was sitting outside on her porch in Boston with her older sister, Aja David, who was baby-sitting her at the time.</p><p>It was around the Fourth of July, when the sound of fireworks is common. \"All of a sudden that was the sound, although it was different. It was a gunshot,\" says Aja, now 25, on a visit to StoryCorps. \"Someone was shooting. Not at us, but in our direction. I just was thinking about my little sister.\"</p><p>She grabbed Kai and laid her down inside. When she turned Kai on her side, she saw a circle of blood on her jacket. \"[Kai] just said, 'I want Mommy,' and I said, 'You know I love you, right?' \" Aja recalls. \"I think at 14 it was drilled in me, like, that's your family. You don't let anything happen to your sisters.\"</p><p>Kai doesn't remember much from that night, but she knew her sister felt the burden of guilt. \"A few years later, I found a card that you wrote me when I was in the hospital, and it was a card with you blaming yourself, and how you were sorry that you didn't protect me,\" Kai says.</p><p>\"For you to blame yourself â€” there's no need for that. Sometimes I blame myself like, 'You're a 3-year-old. You should have been asleep. Like, what are you doing up?' But you have to realize that it wasn't your fault.\"</p><p>Aja says she doesn't blame herself anymore. \"I was only 14, and you're now the age that I was when that happened to our family,\" Aja says to Kai.</p><p>\"Since that day we've always had a tight bond, and I feel as if I'm your guardian angel, and you're mine,\" Kai says.</p><p><em>Produced for </em>Morning Edition<em> by Jasmyn Belcher Morris.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
