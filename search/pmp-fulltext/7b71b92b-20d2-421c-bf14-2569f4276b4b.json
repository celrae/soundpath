The Bala Brothers are Zwai, Loyiso and Phelo Bala, and they have been commanding attention in their home country since the 12-year-old Zwai became the first black member of the renowned Drakensburg boys choir, six years before apartheid ended. The brothers eventually became national stars, performing R&B, <em><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128014019\" target=\"_blank\">kwaito</a></em>, gospel and even opera, singing in English, Afrikaans and their native Xhosa.<br /> <br />Now the Bala Brothers will reach stateside ears with a performance broadcast on PBS stations, plus the companion album, DVD and Blu-ray disc.
