In effect, it became an open season whereby everybody was helping themselves. And ISIS themselves have even started hiring contractors, and in some cases providing the heavy earth-moving equipment necessary to do some of this work. And the damage is immeasurable.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On why antiquities can help stabilization</strong></p><p>&#8220;There are many aspects of what makes a Syrian feel that he&#8217;s a Syrian.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I believe that one of those common denominators is the Syrian people&#8217;s appreciation and understanding of their common shared history and cultural heritage. So preserving this cultural heritage is going to be very important if people are going to be able to reconnect with those symbols that once helped them identify themselves as Syrians, as opposed to this fragmented state they are now.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.shawnee.edu/academics/social-sciences/faculty/aalazm.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Amr Al-Azm</a></strong>, associate professor of anthropology and Middle Eastern history at Shawnee State University in Ohio.
