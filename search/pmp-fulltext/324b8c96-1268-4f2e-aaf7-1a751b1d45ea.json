It's into the minus-40s, so pretty typical for Yellowknife,” says CBC North meteorologist Christy Climenhaga, who's in northern Canada. “I have a little cocker spaniel and she loves it up here. We have a good winter jacket for her; you need little boots so their feet don't get too cold. All the dogs seem to love getting outside and running across our frozen lakes and all that fun stuff.”</p>\n<p>Climenhaga's best advice?
