What surprised me was how often I was hearing funny stories and really joyful stories,\" she says. \"A lot of the photographs that I found are truly joyous photographs, pictures from the '20s and '30s that are, like, snapshots of people making rabbit ears behind each other's heads, people splashing in the water, picnics — truly just a snapshot of life that I didn't expect to see in a period in Ukraine where I thought of life as being only grim.”</p>\n<p>Sindelar thinks these images of ordinary life also defy Western stereotypes about drab Soviet existence.</p>\n<p>“I think we’re all accustomed to imagining this part of the world based on ... images of peasants working the land or Soviet soldiers or grey bureaucrats,\" she says. \"What really amazed me were beautiful pictures of the countryside, and also images of their native culture. ... You really get a sense of a nation that had an identity at the turn of the 20th century, and then spent most of the 20th century fighting to hold onto even a part of it.”</p>\n<p>One photo in particular captures that sense for Sindelar. It was shown to her by a gentleman named Vladimir in the city of Uzhhorod, a border city in western Ukraine where almost everyone speaks Hungarian, Ukrainian and Russian.</p>\n<p>“I think it's the kind of picture you can get lost in,\" Sindelar says. \"It shows two adults sitting on either side of the picnic table, with maybe eight or 10 teenage girls sitting between. The woman at the head of the table is raising a glass as though she’s offering a toast, and she's got a broad smile on her face, almost a playful smile. Everyone is looking at her so intently, including the man who looks besotted and maybe a little bit like maybe he's being teased a little bit. Each person's expression is so wonderful, so mysterious. What's going on in this picture? I want to know.\"</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-story_image\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/story_main/public/s6-5.jpg?itok=kY8cgHKH\" width=\"937\" height=\"552\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p><em>My Ukraine: Memory and Identity:</em> Pavlo Holovakha (L) during military service with the Black Sea Fleet, early 1940's.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Courtesy Daisy Sindelar</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"811\" width=\"1200\" alt=\"In 2001, Sindelar accompanied a group of Russian explorers to the Arctic.
