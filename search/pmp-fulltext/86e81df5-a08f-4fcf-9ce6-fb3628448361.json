We have to start putting taxes and prices on the things that we burn that we don&#8217;t want in our economy, and then take the funds from that and invest it in what we need, and what we need are jobs in a clean economy.&#8221;</p><p>Kyte says that while the United States has not signed on to the coalition, there are individual states in the US that are in the process of developing a system for carbon pricing. China is part of the coalition, and is developing pilot programs for carbon trading in various provinces and cities, with the goal of having a national carbon trading system by 2017.</p><p>Kyte says because leadership from both government and private industry are working together in this coalition, it allows for &#8220;broadening the political space within which people can negotiate.&#8221;</p><ul><li><strong>The World Bank</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-carbon\">Putting a Price on Carbon</a></li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/people/vp-rachel-kyte\">Rachel Kyte</a></strong>, vice president of the World Bank Group and special envoy for climate change.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
