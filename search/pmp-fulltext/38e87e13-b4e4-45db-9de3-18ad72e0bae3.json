That sentence will have many different meanings for different people, but consider this: The cover of Todd's book <em>After</em> boasts that the online work from which it's drawn has been viewed a <em>billion</em> times via a service called <a href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/\">Wattpad</a>. Given <em>Fifty Shades Of Grey</em>'s roots as <em>Twilight</em> fan fiction, and given that <em>Fifty Shades</em> has sold more than 100 million copies worldwide, it's not hard to understand why the publishing industry has taken an interest.</p><p>So I pulled aside NPR Books' resident fan-fiction expert, Petra Mayer — don't miss <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/11/03/360209628/after-fifty-shades-could-this-be-the-next-big-online-hit\">her piece</a> on <em>After</em> for Monday's episode of <em>Morning Edition</em> — to ask for her thoughts on fan fiction, \"slash fiction,\" ways writers interact with their readers, <em>After</em> and its impact on the future of publishing. And, because it's Petra and Petra is awesome, we couldn't let the discussion pass without a few recommendations: She's especially fond of <a href=\"http://www.naominovik.com/temeraire/\">these books</a> by Naomi Novik, who got her start in fan fiction, and <a href=\"http://www.whofic.com/viewstory.php?sid=25841\">this work</a> by a writer called Doyle, who she says mashes up <em>Doctor Who</em> and <em>Black Adder</em> for a story worthy of both.</p><p><em>ADDENDUM: Petra just emailed us to say, \"I realized in horror this morning that I had named the Leaky Cauldron as the Harry Potter fanfic site, when in fact, it is the Sugar Quill. Accio bag to hide my head under!\"</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
