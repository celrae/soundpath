With the wide use of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and various other social networking sites everyone can become a celebrity &#8212; at least when it comes to simple factoids like mother&#8217;s maiden name or place of birth.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Create an email address difficult to hack into. If you have an email using your first or last name or date of birth, an outside party could easily use email to break into your accounts, including financial ones.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Make a separate email account that you only use for your most sensitive accounts. But make sure to make that email address a complex one that isn&#8217;t easy to hack.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Make sure your password is complex that is at least 10 characters long with numbers as well as other symbols and a combination of lower-and-uppercase letters.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.idt911.com/en-us/company/leadership/adam-levin\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Adam Levin</strong></a>, chairman and founder of Identity Theft 911, and former director of the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs.
