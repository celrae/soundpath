The first thing he noticed when he got to Coppelia was the long lines, he says. For Cubans, though, the line is part of the experience.</p>\n<p>\"Cubans are used to waiting. It's something they've been doing since they were kids,\" he explains. \"It's about going there, seeing friends [and] meeting new people.\"</p>\n<p>The ice cream is good, Motlagh says, but Cubans he met remembered better times.</p>\n<p>\"[They said] quality has suffered and that there used to be upwards of 50 flavors ... and now you're lucky if you get three or four flavors,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Customers also suspect that the store is using powdered milk to make its ice-cream. That's because of the economic restrictions and embargo that Cuba has endured over the years.</p>\n<p>Motlagh says he didn't get a response from the staff when he pressed them on that issue.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"600\" width=\"900\" alt=\"Ice-cream served at Coppelia in Havana, Cuba.\" title=\"Ice-cream served at Coppelia in Havana, Cuba.\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/20150221_CPLA_135.JPG?itok=Om-OFNFz\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Ice cream served at Coppelia in Havana, Cuba.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Courtesy of Lisette Poole</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>But regardless of the quality of its ice cream today, Coppelia has a long history in Cuba. Cuban leader Fidel Castro fell in love with ice cream after tasting it on a trip to the US. After he returned, he ordered his ambassador to Canada to ship him 28 containers of ice cream from Howard Johnson's, \"which was like the Baskin Robins of the time.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then he was like, 'You know what? We can do this. We can do it better,'\" says Motlagh. And that's when the idea for a Cuban ice cream shop was born.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"600\" width=\"900\" alt=\"“Coppelia is more than an ice-cream shop.
