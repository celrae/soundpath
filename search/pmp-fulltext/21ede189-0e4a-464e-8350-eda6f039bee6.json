Not just the buddy-cop movie, but the buddy-frat movie, the depressingly rare female-buddy movie, and whatever else they come up with to create what Glen calls \"the background noise of American popular culture.\" We talk about whether the straight-man/comic dynamic is going away, the long history of buddies, and the \"bromance\" idea with which not all of us are entirely comfortable.</p><p>Then we move on to a second topic about first impressions. First lines, first shots, and the epic sound effect that, to me, kicks off the most marathon-able show on television. Tanya brings a movie, Stephen brings music, and Glen hits us with some first lines from books, as you can imagine. (Believe me, he had more. We're hoping to post a list of what he brought, if there's room on the internet.)</p><p>Stephen is happy about a couple of remembrances, including a great <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2014/06/16/322570387/for-casey-kasem-a-long-distance-dedication\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a> about Casey Kasem and his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCZZs4smt34\" target=\"_blank\">own love</a> of Jimmy Scott. Glen is happy about needing to figure two things out: what happened with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ghweldon/status/477858390052716544\" target=\"_blank\">a tweet</a> he had success with, and also the appeal of <em>Game Of Thrones</em>. Tanya is happy about getting an opportunity to hang out and party with her fellow lovers of the legacy of one of her very favorite artists.
