Brown came to study play after studying something much more somber: the lives of murderers. He found a common thread in their life stories: lack of play in childhood. Since then, he's interviewed thousands of people to catalog their relationships with play, noting a strong correlation between playful activity and success. His book <em>Play</em> describes the impact that play can have on one's life.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
