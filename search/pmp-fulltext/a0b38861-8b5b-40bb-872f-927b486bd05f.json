But it's also about the grub. Chips, dip, hot wings, and of course, pizza. Domino's Pizza alone expects to sell more than 11 million slices on game day, and says its delivery guys will cover the equivalent of 300 roundtrips between San Francisco and Baltimore. To see how a company gears up for the Super Bowl of pizza eating, I dropped by a Domino's outlet in Culver City, Calif., where I met franchise owner Dan Hosseini. In a normal day, Hosseini makes about 100-200 pizzas.</p>\n<p>\"Towards the end of the week, we tend to sell more. Our stores range anywhere from say 400 to about 500, 600 pizzas per day,\" says Hosseini. \"Super Bowl is also Super Bowl for us. We tend to get much busier than average. Usually we do maybe anywhere from twice to three times the normal volume on Super Bowl Sunday.\" &nbsp;</p>\n<p>That adds up to anywhere from 400-1,200 orders. That's a whole lot of pepperoni. And a whole lot of hands on deck. Hosseini says \"we've got the entire staff working, prepping from early in the morning, getting ready for the business. All the folks that are working inside the store, the entire driving staff are scheduled to work. We're really working literally from 8 o'clock in the morning prepping all the way to midnight, 1 o'clock just to manage the business.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/life/super-bowl-ad-flops\"><img src=\"http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/160451784.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a> <strong><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/life/super-bowl-ad-flops\">Super Bowl ad flops</a>&nbsp;</strong>Even if you don't actually watch the Super Bowl game, everyone watches the Super Bowl ads.
