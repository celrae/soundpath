Its last studio album, <em>The Division Bell</em>, came out in 1994. This week, the group released what it's described as a \"final\" album, <em>The Endless River</em>.</p><p>It's less a major new work and more a glimpse into the legendary band's process. Inside these gussied-up fragments from the archives are all of Pink Floyd's trademarks: majestic processionals that move at a glacial pace, otherworldly synthscapes and (of course) the gorgeous, perpetually questing lead guitar of David Gilmour.</p><p>Just one thing is missing: songs. You know, like, with words and melodies. There's only one of those, and it's called \"Louder Than Words.\"</p><p>This \"new\" album was recorded mostly in 1993, during sessions for <em>The Division Bell</em>. Pink Floyd recorded 20 hours of ambient interludes intended to connect the songs, then left them on the cutting-room floor. After keyboardist Rick Wright died in 2008, Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason revisited the material. They tweaked and in some cases added new parts to the atmospheric pieces.</p><p>This film-score stuff isn't for those who are just discovering Pink Floyd and have yet to spend the wee hours with <em>The Dark Side Of The Moon</em>. But for the superfan, it offers a peek into the inner workings of the Pink Floyd architecture. The absence of narrative makes it possible to focus on the musical details â€” the tones and plush textures, the peaks and valleys this band spun into vivid, enchanting, epic journeys.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
