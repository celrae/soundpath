It would be a victory for proponents of &#8220;net neutrality&#8221; &#8211; those who oppose a system in which companies could pay Internet service providers for faster delivery of their content.</p><p>As a regulated public utility, Internet service providers would not be able to charge companies for Internet &#8220;fast lanes.&#8221;</p><p>Critics of a tiered system include President Obama, who says allowing some large companies to pay for faster content delivery would &#8220;end the Internet as we know it.&#8221; Many consumers, as well as content providers like Apple and Google, also support net neutrality.</p><p>Broadband companies including AT&T, Comcast, Cox and Verizon, as well as some members of Congress, oppose FCC regulation, saying it could unleash greater taxes and fees and could actually stifle innovation and access.</p><p>However approval of the FCC regulations would not mean the battle over net neutrality is over. The fight could continue in the courts, or the regulations could be overturned by a more Republican-leaning Federal Communications Commission, under a future administration.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/authors/allan-holmes\" target=\"_blank\">Allan Holmes</a></strong>, senior reporter at <a href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Center for Public Integrity</a>.
