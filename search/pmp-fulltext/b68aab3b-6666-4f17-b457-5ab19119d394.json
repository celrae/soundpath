If you've ever tried to concentrate on work while a trombone player tunes his instrument a few feet away, then you know what concentration is.</p><p>Seriously, though, the concerts are so much fun, and we were thrilled when NPR Music announced its first-ever <a href=\"http://tinydeskcontest.npr.org/winner\">Tiny Desk Concert Contest</a>. The premise was that bands from all across the U.S. should send in videos of themselves performing behind a desk. The prize: a chance to perform at NPR Music's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/tiny-desk-concerts/\" target=\"_blank\">Tiny Desk</a>, as well as at the Lagunitas \"<a href=\"http://lagunitas.com/couchtrippin-npr\" target=\"_blank\">CouchTrippin' To Austin</a>\" show in March. And, while there could only be one winner, we received more than 7,000 performance videos for our consideration.</p><p>This week on <em>Alt.Latino</em>, we share some of our favorite Latin contestants in the competition. And don't forget that, even though this was a special event, we're always open to submissions â€” it's how we get some of our best music on this show. So keep sending it in!</p><p>And, if you haven't already, check out the winner of the contest: the soulful, mesmerizing <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/02/12/385540871/meet-the-winner-of-our-tiny-desk-concert-contest\">Fantastic Negrito</a>.
