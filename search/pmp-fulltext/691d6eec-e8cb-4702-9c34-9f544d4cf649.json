In Brazil, they are potentially deadly. It's the place where the mosquito-born virus dengue fever is most prevalent.</p><p>Enter the Zapping Racket. As the name implies, it is an electrified tennis racket that kills mosquitoes.</p><p>I know, right? <em>Genius</em>.</p><p>On a recent afternoon, while reporting this story, I was waving my hands frantically in the air trying to kill a mosquito with said racket while my husband James and his sister Claire — who is visiting from the U.K. — looked on. After a victorious sizzle I confronted my husband.</p><p>\"How would you describe my racket technique?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Pretty poor,\" he answered, rather judgmentally in my opinion.</p><p>However, just as he said that, another mosquito accidentally hit my racket. Apparently I don't even need to try to kill mosquitoes; they just naturally come to me.</p><p>My husband immediately busted my self-congratulatory bubble.</p><p>\"I think it was a suicide,\" he said.</p><p>Though common in other parts of the world, in Brazil the racket is ubiquitous: street sellers hawk them, they are sold in stores and every house has one. They are deeply satisfying to use. The rackets even have a little lightning bolt on them so they look like a superhero weapon. When I am using one, I feel like I am a force for good, slaying a relentless enemy.</p><p>In our house, as you can tell, using the racket gets a little competitive. My husband says his forehand technique is superior.</p><p>\"It brings out the hunter instinct and it's guilt-free, because nobody likes mosquitoes and I am protecting my 2-year-old,\" he says rather grandly.</p><p>But the real reason he likes the zapping racket: \"They are addictive. It's like playing tennis, but existential death tennis, with bugs.\"</p><p>I've been in some houses where people actually cheer after a particularly fruitful zapping.</p><p>Now, this might seem cruel or unsavory, but mosquitoes in Brazil are a round-the-clock menace. You have the ones that come out at dusk and bite you at night; they might carry yellow fever or malaria. And then you have the ones that bite you during the day, and they could be carrying dengue fever.</p><p>It's awful.</p><p>So a zapping racket is actually not only fun but rather necessary. And I'm not the only one who gets that superhero feeling when they use it.</p><p>Claire, my husband's sister, had never used a zap racket before she came to visit us. The other day I caught her waving it around in the air like a saber.</p><p>Needless to say, she is taking one back to Scotland when she leaves.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
