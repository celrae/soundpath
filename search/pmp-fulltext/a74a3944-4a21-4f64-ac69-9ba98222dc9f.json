This does not exactly make us outliers in the critical landscape, but we sit down this week with the great Kat Chow of NPR's Code Switch team to talk about the film. It's a thought-provoking story and visually inventive, so we'll spend some time on the various creative forces at work. At the same time, we ding its one weak scene that unfortunately shows up in a lot of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUAzGQ3nSY\" target=\"_blank\">trailers</a> and we debate who cried the most. (Spoiler alert: the parent.)</p><p>Speaking of parents, we got talking this week about why television in particular has such a tendency to rob parents of the vitality of their romantic lives once they have kids â€” and why married couples in general often are reduced to people who are only sexy for laughs. It's a good time to listen again to \"Stacy's Mom,\" but then, there's really no bad time.</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about finding himself wildly overserved by the culture, particularly because of a new <a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/video/sylvan-esso-covers-gillian-welch-220892\" target=\"_blank\">performance video</a>. Glen is happy about <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3164198/\" target=\"_blank\">a documentary</a> for which he admits he's not the most obvious audience and <a href=\"http://gimletmedia.com/show/mystery-show/\" target=\"_blank\">a podcast</a> (shocker!) of which I can tell you I'm also a fan. Kat is happy about <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693769-your-face-in-mine\" target=\"_blank\">a book</a> she found particular relevant in the last week or two. I am happy about a bizarre piece of television performance art (kind of, kind of) as well as a segment of a great <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aziz_Ansari:_Buried_Alive\" target=\"_blank\">comedy special</a> I hope you'll seek out.</p><p>Find us <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pchh\" target=\"_blank\">on Facebook</a> or follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nprpchh\" target=\"_blank\">the show</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nprmonkeysee\" target=\"_blank\">me</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/idislikestephen\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ghweldon\" target=\"_blank\">Glen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/katchow\" target=\"_blank\">Kat</a>, producer <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jessica_reedy\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica</a>, other producer <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/kianafitz\" target=\"_blank\">Kiana</a>, and pal and producer emeritus <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/mikekatzif\" target=\"_blank\">Mike</a>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
