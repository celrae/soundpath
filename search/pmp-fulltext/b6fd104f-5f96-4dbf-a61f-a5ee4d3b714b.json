An engineer and the show's technical director for many years, Deputy died Sunday of lung cancer in New Orleans at the age of 58.</p><p>Sound was a serious business for Bill. When he wasn't combining words and sound with music in the <em>All Things Considered</em> control room, he was traveling with us on assignments. We worked together everywhere from Baltimore to Gaza City, and his assignments with my colleagues were equally far-flung.</p><p>In 2006, the spring after Hurricane Katrina, he was the recording engineer who captured me with commentator Andrei Codrescu in the midst of a bawdy St. Anne's Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans' French Quarter.</p><p>With half-naked revelers jostling Bill, this was no easy task. But somehow he was able to get the music and voices on his recording machine to sound clear — and on the air within hours.</p><p>Bill's touch could often be heard on our stories — sometimes in big ways, other times in a small adjustment in volume or timing. So I'm not remembering Bill here simply to acknowledge the passing of one of <em>our</em> friends. Over his two decades here, he was your friend, too — making radio storytelling better in countless small ways.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
