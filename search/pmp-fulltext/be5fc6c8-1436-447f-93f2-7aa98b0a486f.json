Because the virus isn't in the blood in the first stages of infection.","itags":["npr_api","359567808"],"guid":"be5fc6c8-1436-447f-93f2-7aa98b0a486f","contentencoded":"<p>In an ideal world, health care workers returning from West Africa would get a quick blood test to prove they aren't carrying the Ebola virus. A test like that would likely put to rest some of the anxiety surrounding these doctors, nurses and scientists.</p><p>Unfortunately, even the best blood test in the world can't do that.</p><p>The test uses a technology called PCR, for polymerase chain reaction. It can detect extraordinarily small traces of genetic material from the Ebola virus.</p><p>But the catch is, the test is usually used on blood samples. And <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/10/20/357626090/when-reassuring-isnt-cruises-needless-rush-to-test-for-ebola\">in the beginning</a>, that's not where the Ebola virus hides.</p><p>\"The initial sites of replication actually are not in the blood itself — they're mostly in tissues like spleen or liver,\" says <a href=\"http://microbiology.utmb.edu/faculty/Geisbert.asp\">Thomas Geisbert</a>, a microbiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.</p><p>It's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/10/19/357350663/healthcare-worker-on-cruise-ship-tests-negative-for-ebola\">not practical</a> to sample these organs to look for Ebola. But the virus doesn't stay there forever, Geisbert explains. As the infection grows, virus particles are gradually released into the blood, as well.</p><p>And as soon as a small amount of virus ends up in the blood, PCR will detect it. It can find one or two virus particles in a drop of blood. That concentration is so low, Geisbert says, that an infected person's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/08/21/342203465/what-s-the-outlook-for-ebola-survivors-like-dr-brantly\">body fluids</a> pose a minuscule risk to others at that stage. The problem is, that can change pretty quickly.</p><p>\"As the disease progresses, and people start to get sick,\" he says, \"in that same small drop of blood [there can be] 100 particles — or a thousand particles.\"</p><p>That's the point when body fluids do pose a risk. It's also the moment when the infected person starts to feel sick.</p><p>\"You're going to start to detect the virus at about the same time you're going to have clinical signs of disease,\" Geisbert says.</p><p>So — sensitive as the PCR test is — it doesn't reliably give you much advance warning that a person is infected.</p><p>On the plus side, this pattern of infection also explains why people infected with Ebola aren't a risk to others until they actually fall ill with symptoms.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
