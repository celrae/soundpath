Parked outside a gigantic casino and performance venue in Thackerville, Okla., Nelson offers NPR's David Greene a joint, which Greene declines. Nelson says he understands.</p><p>At 82, Nelson is still touring the country, still an advocate for legalized marijuana — he's even started a new company to sell weed in Colorado — and has a new memoir out called <em>It's A Long Story</em>. The country legend recently spoke to Greene about the mystery of Willie Nelson, how ex-wives are really \"additional wives\" and why no one can tell him what to do.</p><p>\"A friend of mine once said, 'It's my mouth, I'll haul coal in it if I want to,' \" Nelson says. \"I thought, 'That's pretty cool. I'll use that.' I don't think anybody should tell me or you or anybody what to do. I think the Bible says it's not what goes into your mouth that counts; it's what comes out.\"</p><p><strong>Producers would tell you your phrasing is off. What does that mean?</strong></p><p>It means change producers.</p><p><strong>Touché. What does that mean, your phrasing is unique?</strong></p><p>If you've got to explain that, you've got the wrong one. There are so many beats in a measure, you have so much time to get in so many beats, some people lay back to the last minute. ... Some do a beat every quarter. However you feel it is the way you should do it. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15396980/frank-sinatra\">Sinatra</a>'s best asset was his ability to phrase. He's my favorite singer. It's how you say it.</p><p><strong>I did a lot of reading before coming to meet you. People who know you very well say you remain a mystery. The true Willie Nelson doesn't come out easily. We know this whole massive catalog of songs; can we know you through that catalog? Do you remain a mystery?</strong></p><p>I don't know ... I loved every song <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15199726/hank-williams\">Hank Williams</a> wrote. Doesn't mean I knew him any better. Music says a lot about you. I'm guessing ... maybe so? Maybe my music does tell stories I wouldn't be able to tell any other way unless it was through a song.</p><p><strong>Amazing story you tell in the book: You land in jail in the Bahamas because of your love of pot. Two days later, you're at the White House having dinner with President Carter. That evening, you said a friend of yours, a White House insider, knocks on your door, takes you on a tour and lights up a joint.</strong></p><p>Hrm. Were you there?</p><p><strong>No, I just read the book.</strong></p><p>[Laughs.] I didn't know I put that in the book.</p><p><strong>Do you have regrets about how you treated women? Would you change it?</strong></p><p>No. No. Most of the women in my life knew that they were taking a big chance with a guitar player, anywhere. Not that that's an excuse. Guitar players do like women. That's why we got into the business; we like girls. That can lead to trouble if you're planning family life. Which I did. I have four wives, kids, grandkids, I love them all. There's no such thing as ex-wives; there's only additional wives.</p><p><strong>I see there are photos behind you, [including] one of your late son, Billy ...</strong></p><p>Oh, there he is, with his daughter, my granddaughter. There he is on Scout, his pony. Another one back here.</p><p><strong>He died a very early death. You outlived a son. You lost people you played on stage with. You talk about <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/16320091/waylon-jennings\">Jennings</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15165794/johnny-cash\">Cash</a>, ... How does that loss around you impact you and your life today?</strong></p><p>Me and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15197129/merle-haggard\">Merle</a> were talking, ain't many of us left.</p><p><strong>Merle Haggard.</strong></p><p>We were chuckling about that. Where'd everybody go? The fact he and I are still here is probably a miracle in itself.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
