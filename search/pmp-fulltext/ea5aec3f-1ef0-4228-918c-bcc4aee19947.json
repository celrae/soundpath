But eventually, she stepped down from the role to make time for playing other characters.</p><p>&#8220;It became clear that it was going to be something that I would have to spend a lot of time on and I didn&#8217;t want to lose the sketch side of the show.&#8221;</p><p>Strong did sit in a newsroom set again recently, but this time as CNN news anchor Brooke Baldwin, in a sketch that poked fun at the network&#8217;s coverage of the Germanwings plane crash. Making jokes around the tragedy wasn&#8217;t easy for Strong.</p><p>&#8220;It made me terribly nervous,&#8221; Strong said. &#8220;But I think you have to be able to laugh at things, and it wasn&#8217;t about the plane crash. That is what CNN was talking about, and to make fun of how they talk about it, I think that was a really important distinction.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATXbJjuZqbc\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/about/bio/cecily-strong\" target=\"_blank\">Cecily Strong</a></strong>, actress, comedian and cast member on Saturday Night Live.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
