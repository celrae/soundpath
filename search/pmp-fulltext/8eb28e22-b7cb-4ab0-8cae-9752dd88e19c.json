From institutions of higher education or from research institutions,” Rueland says.<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>According to the DAAD, half of foreign students getting a degree in Germany will stay. That's not just in the short term either — 40 percent of students plan on remaining for at least 10 years. In the U.S., only 12 percent of international students opt to stay for even one year.<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>When asked whether Germany is competing with American universities for the same talent, Rueland doesn't hesitate.<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>“We are part of this world and we cannot neglect these trends going on. So of course, we are competitors,” she says.<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>But Rueland is also quick to point out competing is only part of the picture. The other part is cooperation.<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>“If you look at the global challenges everybody’s talking about, questions of climate change, energy, water, high-tech ... this cannot be solved by one institution or one country,” Rueland says. “So you have to have big international networks. We all know this. This is actually the mission we have.”<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>Some American universities have said they share that mission of cooperation — and they don’t see Germany as competition, yet.<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p><strong>A mobile degree</strong><br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>Back in Cologne, a group of Americans who are now part of that international network try to work out whether they see themselves working in Germany or the U.S. after graduation.<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>“I want to see what the workforce is like [in Germany], like a full-time job and see if I enjoy it,” says Glen Bornhoft, a recent graduate from the University of Cologne. “Because so far I really enjoy studying here and meeting all the different types of people that I've met.”<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>Andrew Kinder, who is studying business administration, agrees.<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>“I think that would be the more realistic way to have it pay off, to start the next phase of my career here in Germany, and hope with an international corporation, or an American corporation, and at some point maybe move back to the States,\" he says.<br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>But Natasha Turner, who is studying for her master’s in North American studies, isn't as sure.<br />\n<br /></p>\n<center><img src=\"http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/Germany-1_0.jpg\" /><br /></center>\n<p><em>American Natasha Turner is completing her master's degree at the University of Cologne.
