Name a famous actor whose first and last names both are seven letters long. Change the first three letters of the actor's last name to three new letters and you'll name another famous actor. They share the same first name. Add the three letters you changed in the first actor's last name plus the three letters you changed to get the second actor's name, and you'll spell the last name of a third famous actor. Who are these three Hollywood stars?</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Anthony Hopkins, Anthony Perkins, Dennis Hopper.</p><p><strong>Winner: </strong>Warren Orloff of Worthington, Ohio. <strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>Next week's challenge: </strong>Think of a common two-word phrase for something you might see in a kitchen. Reverse the words — that is, put the second word in front of the first — and you'll name a food, in one word, that you might prepare in a kitchen.
