What do you do on the weekend? Like do you probably jump out of an airplane?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Go to a waterslide park?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Yeah, rehydrate. A waterslide park is probably the right move.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Cool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Well Jason Schwartzman, that you so much for coming on our show.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Hey, can we do it again where it’s not as rushed?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I would love to have you here.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> Okay, cool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> And now you can return to your narcissistic bubble and I’ll return to mine too.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> I never left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I didn’t even notice you were there.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> No, it’s for me to come here and just be asked a lot of questions and talk about myself. It’s truly the best way to spend an afternoon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Alright, cool. That’s what I like to do too, but I took turns with you this time. Next time you can interview me.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jason Schwartzman:</strong> No thanks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br /></div>","audio":[{"meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/166995068sq.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"meta":{"duration":478,"api":{"href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm_audio:/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2014/10/24/1024_schwartzman","type":"application/json"},"duration_hms":"00:07:58"},"type":"audio/mpeg","href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2014/10/24/1024_schwartzman_128.mp3","format":"MP3"}]}
