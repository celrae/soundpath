Thousands of people were evacuated from the local towns of Pucon and Conaripe as a precaution. </p>\n<p>Just imagine being awoken in the middle of the night by a siren — and seeing those fiery explosions in the night sky out your window.</p>\n<p>Jose Manuel Reyes runs a La Bicicleta hostel in Puncon for foreign tourists. He and his guests watched the Villarrica volcano from the back yard.</p>\n<p>“We saw a huge bullet of magma, almost twice the size of the volcano itself. It was spectacular. Then lava started to flow from the volcano. I was a little bit scared because it’s my first experience with eruptions like that,\" he says. \"For now I think I'm safe. But we never really know what's going to happen. I've been reading about the history of this volcano and it's not going to make a big, big eruption — I hope. I hope, because you never know.”</p>\n<p>The dramatic photos of the eruption demonstrate the power of Villarrica volcano.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\"><p>A Chilean volcano has erupted...the latest: <a href=\"http://t.co/cXqC9z9CQu\">http://t.co/cXqC9z9CQu</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/IbMEnQBkLl\">pic.twitter.com/IbMEnQBkLl</a></p>\n<p>— The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/weatherchannel/status/572754551289356288\">March 3, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>“We woke up about 3 a.m. There was some yelling and screaming out on the street, car alarms going off,\" says Chris, a Canadian tourist staying at Reyes' hostel. \"We looked out the window and saw the top of the volcano.
