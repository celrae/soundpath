But because this market is being manipulated lower, in part by the OPEC cartel, it&#8217;s causing a lot of pain.</p><p>&#8220;Capital expenditures in the energy industry are going to be cut dramatically. Jobs in the U.S. energy industry are going to be cut. And people have to realize that the U.S. energy industry has been one of the strong parts of the U.S. economy.&#8221;</p><p>Flynn says if the energy industry takes a hit, it could lead to job losses in other industries. Additionally, Flynn says the drop in oil prices is &#8220;killing&#8221; short term investment in alternative energy.</p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of banks that have lent the energy industry a lot of money, a lot of these alternative energy industries a lot of money. They are going to think twice before they lend money in the future,&#8221; Flynn said.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.pricegroup.com/bio_phil-flynn.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Phil Flynn</a></strong>, energy market analyst at <a href=\"http://www.pricegroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Price Futures Group</a>.
