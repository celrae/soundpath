Wireless used to be a great business because you could basically charge whatever you wanted for data —and Verizon did. That’s changing, so it's making less money on wireless. On the broadband access side, there are the looming net neutrality regulations — if broadband and wireless internet access are reclassified as utilities, that will limit Verizon’s flexibility around what it can charge for access.

So even if Verizon does launch its own video streaming service, why would anyone use it when they still have YouTube and Facebook? Oh, and what if it's only on Verizon? That leaves out a huge chunk of the market that might never see those ads.</span></p>\n<p><span>Meanwhile, if&nbsp;<span>Verizon launches its own streaming video service, then it’s suddenly in the content business.
