So we’re always reluctant to weigh in and make any comment on what’s happening in another city. We’re all walking precariously, trying to just toe that tightrope between saying that this is America and everybody has the right to demonstrate and speak out – which they do. On the other hand, what is incendiary, what is too much? What are the limits? We’re all so afraid – I talked to mayors all over the country, and we’re all just wondering, ‘Could it happen here?’ I don’t know quite frankly. It could. I guess all I can say Jeremy is that all life is precious.”</p><p><strong>On how mayors should handle potential clashes </strong></p><p>“You want mayors that are reflective. Who learn that words can be just as lethal as bullets. It’s just amazing that we don’t have more confrontations like this.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.memphistn.gov/Government/ExecutiveDivision/MayorsOffice.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>A.C.
