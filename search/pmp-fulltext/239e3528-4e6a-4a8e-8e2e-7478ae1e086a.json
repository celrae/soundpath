From 2011 to 2012 the office made 15 convictions. Together those cases involved 545 victims whose losses totaled $173 million. But what about the people higher up the food chain -- the Wall Street participants who packaged and sold fraudulent loans? <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/after-lehman/five-years-later-lehman-executive-handyman\" target=\"_blank\">Where are they</a> five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers?<br />\n<br />\n\"The answer to that is that overwhelmingly they are simply where they were before except they are much wealthier,\" says William Black, a former bank regulator and expert in white collar crime.<br />\n<br />\nHe and his colleagues at the Federal Loan Bank of San Francisco were instrumental in exposing corrupt members of Congress during the Saving and Loan Crisis of the 80s and 90s. So it made sense that he was asked to testify before Congress in 2010. He explained to the Committee on Financial Services in detail how Lehman's collapse was the direct result of fraud. \"It had an entire operation, Lehman Brothers, called Aurora that specialized entirely in making liar loans,\" says Black.<br />\n<br />\nHe also singled out Lehman as the largest purveyor of liar loans -- loans that required no proof of income -- in the country. After his testimony, Black was surprised that none of the committee members asked him any follow-up questions. To date there has not been a single criminal prosecution of any the Wall Street executives involved in the financial crisis.<br />\n<br />\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/after-lehman\"><img src=\"http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/200x200/public/field_images/2013/09/bankruptcylehman.jpg?itok=4ltgcjBP\" alt=\"\" /></a></div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/after-lehman\"></a>\n<p><strong><span>Lehman's Legacy: A Timeline</span></strong> <em>Follow the key events before and after the Lehman Brothers collapse, and see how the financial crisis unfolded. <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/after-lehman\">Follow the timeline</a></em></p>\n</div>\n</div></div>","guid":"239e3528-4e6a-4a8e-8e2e-7478ae1e086a","itags":["PMP:Marketplace_PMP","Marketplace Morning Report for Thursday, September 12, 2013","Marketplace Morning Report","Marketplace","239e35284e6aa8e6e2ef7478ae1e086a"],"tags":["APM","After Lehman","Business","financial crisis","subprime lenders"],"published":"2013-09-12T11:30:39+00:00","audio":[{"type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"crop":"primary","width":"610","height":"340"},"href":"http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/151070206.jpg?itok=SZEJJY4n"},{"type":"audio/mpeg","href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/marketplace/segments/2013/09/12/marketplace_segment03_20130912_64.mp3","meta":{"api":{"type":"application/json","href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm-audio:/marketplace/segments/2013/09/12/marketplace_segment03_20130912"},"duration_hms":"00:02:57","duration":177},"format":"MP3"}]}
