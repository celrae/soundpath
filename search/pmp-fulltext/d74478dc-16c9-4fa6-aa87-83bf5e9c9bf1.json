But over time they came to realize it was an animal. It got a name: the \"bio-duck.\" Although whatever was making this sound had to be a lot bigger than a duck.</p><p>\"The sound is very intense, it's very loud, so the thought was it's probably a larger animal producing the sound,\" says Risch.</p><p>As researchers gathered more data, a suspect emerged: the <a href=\"http://www.marinemammalscience.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=407&Itemid=274\">Antarctic minke whale</a>. Not much is known about this particular whale. It's the smallest of the <a href=\"http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/cetaceans/baleen1.php\">baleen whales</a>; it's solitary; and it tends to stay very close to dense sea ice.</p><p>\"That makes them quite hard to study too and that's also part of the reason why the signal has not been identified earlier,\" Risch says.</p><p>But last year, during the Antarctic summer, a team from Duke University was studying the behavior of these whales. Researchers attached an instrument package to one of the whales using suction cups; on board was a microphone. Briefly, in one of the recordings, was a muffled, up-close version of the quack.</p><p>\"They don't sound alike, but the pulses are exactly 3.1 seconds apart from each other,\" says Risch.</p><p>The same as the quacking.</p><p>The frequency of the noise matches too. Risch and her colleagues <a href=\"http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/4/20140175.full#aff-1\">published their work</a> in the journal <em>Biology Letters</em>.</p><p>So, mystery solved. Well, sort of.</p><p>Scientists still don't know why or even how these whales quack.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
