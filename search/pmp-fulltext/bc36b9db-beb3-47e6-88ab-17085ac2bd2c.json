But only a handful of carriers have dared to try going under 30 inches. Those last couple inches are likely the most precious.<br />\n<br />\n“It’s hard to tell what that inch is worth because it’s gonna vary by market, by time of day,” says Addison Schonland of the aviation consultancy IAG.<br />\n<br />\nEven if airlines can’t pinpoint the value of an inch, they’re very cautious about it taking it away. Hard as it may be to believe sometimes, they’re not trying to torture us. New, thinner seats could enable airlines to preserve legroom while adding seats.<br />\n<br />\n“The slimline seats will probably give you about the same amount of legroom,” says aviation consultant Michael Boyd. “Will it be more comfortable? I don’t think so. But it’s not as if they’re turning airplanes into the 7th Avenue subway.”<br />\n<br />\nThere are other potential ways to add seats without losing legroom. Now that food service in coach is dwindling, airlines are creating room for seats by ripping out kitchens.<br />\n<br />\nAt 6’5”, aviation consultant George Hamlin’s interest in airline seating is both personal and professional. Flying coach is never fun for him, and he cringes at the idea of more seats coming in, thin ones or not. But the reality is there’s little choice anymore.<br />\n<br />\n“Domestic economy has become pretty much a commodity product,” Hamlin sighs.<br />\n<br />\nEssentially, passengers are out of luck if they find American’s new seating arrangements too tight. Other carriers are just as jammed. Unless they pay to upgrade and grab a few more inches, increasingly the only place to find more legroom is by driving instead.<br />\n<br /></div>","title":"American Airlines legroom: How much is an inch worth?","audio":[{"href":"http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/legroom.jpg?itok=fShEE3Y9","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":"340","width":"610"},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"format":"MP3","meta":{"duration":127,"api":{"href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm-audio:/marketplace/segments/2013/06/17/marketplace_segment22_20130617","type":"application/json"},"duration_hms":"00:02:07"},"href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/marketplace/segments/2013/06/17/marketplace_segment22_20130617_64.mp3","type":"audio/mpeg"}]}
