In her book <em><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/01/30/145930229/quiet-please-unleashing-the-power-of-introverts\" target=\"_blank\">Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking</a></em>, Cain notes that although our culture undervalues them dramatically, introverts have made some of the great contributions to society. Based on research and interviews, she argues that we design our schools and workplaces for extroverts, and that this bias creates a waste of talent, energy and happiness.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
