I’m sure it was.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> They’ve got the money for CGI steam, but not a heater?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Carrie Brownstein:</strong> Can you believe it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s not cool.&nbsp; All right, so vice-versa, Carrie: What do we not know about Fred?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Carrie Brownstein:</strong> Okay… Fred gave me a look like, “What are you gonna say? Don’t tell them–”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Fred Armisen:</strong> No, I don’t care!</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Carrie Brownstein:</strong> Well, I was gonna say something about an allergy, but I’m going to say this thing that I actually — I love many things about you, Fred — but I actually find this very clever and practical in a certain way. When Fred travels, instead of doing laundry, he will ship, FedEx, his dirty laundry home, and go and buy fresh underwear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> But you don’t <em>throw away</em> your underwear, you FedEx it home?&nbsp; That’s kind of creepy.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Carrie Brownstein:</strong> Which to me, yeah, I always think it does seem weird that you get home, and you open up a box of stinky underwear. But then you just do the laundry there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> I thought you were gonna say that you were shipping it home to your <em>mom</em>.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Carrie Brownstein:</strong> That’s beautiful. That’s sweet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Can you explain why?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Fred Armisen:</strong> I’m a master at traveling. I really make sure that I always pack lightly. It’s just a little bit of carry on luggage. Minimal, minimal. So clothing weighs it all down. So socks and everything else, when I’m done, I ship it all back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> But I don’t understand. It probably costs just as much money to ship underwear across the country FedEx as to buy a new pair of underwear.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Fred Armisen:</strong> I’m loaded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Oh, that’s right! That’s true.</p>\n<br /></div>","published":"2014-03-07T04:07:00+00:00","audio":[{"format":"MP3","type":"audio/mpeg","href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/dinnerpartydownload/2014/03/07/0307_goh_128.mp3","meta":{"duration_hms":"00:07:44","duration":464,"api":{"type":"application/json","href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm_audio:/dinnerpartydownload/2014/03/07/0307_goh"}}}]}
