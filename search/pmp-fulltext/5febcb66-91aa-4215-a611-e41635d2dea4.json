Commentator Frank Deford thinks other causes are more deserving.","itags":["npr_api","356135419"],"guid":"5febcb66-91aa-4215-a611-e41635d2dea4","contentencoded":"<p>That familiar old preface we so often hear — usually from long-winded people — is: \"To make a long story short.\" I've noticed lately that that expression has become more common, but, to make a long story short, it's been shortened to just \"long story short.\" I'll even bet it's gotten initialed in the text universe to LSS.</p><p>Well, long story short, last year I was astonished to discover that guileless fans were actually volunteering their services, for free, <em>gratis, </em>to the Super Bowl — which, of course, makes a gazillion million dollars for the NFL and its gracious owners. Now, incredibly, the NFL is looking for <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nfl/super-bowl/2014/07/29/super-bowl-volunteers-needed/12856203/\">10,000 volunteers</a> to donate their time and effort to this season's Super Bowl in Arizona.</p><p>Of course, I want you to keep in mind that the NFL is <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/01/18/263767372/the-nfl-big-business-with-big-tax-breaks\">officially a nonprofit</a>, even though commissioner Roger Goodell makes in excess of $40 million a year. (Lord knows what they'd pay him if he actually was doing a good job.) Of all the great, needy charities in the world, desperate for volunteers, who, in their right mind, would pick the Super Bowl?</p><p>The 2018 Super Bowl has been awarded to Minneapolis, and thanks to superb <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/262253921.html\">investigative work</a> by the <em>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</em>, a 153-page list of stipulations that the league demanded has been revealed. Here are just some of the NFL demands for what it trumpets as \"America's unofficial holiday\":</p><ul><li>The league gets every cent of ticket revenue</li><li>35,000 free parking spaces</li><li>Free ads in local newspapers and on radio stations, and lots of free billboards (just so we'll know the Super Bowl is in town)</li><li>All ATMs at the stadium must be those with NFL-approved credit cards</li><li>Free presidential suites in the top hotels</li><li>If cellphone reception isn't quite good enough around and about, then Minneapolis has to build the NFL sufficient new cellphone towers</li><li>The NFL even unsuccessfully tried to demand the right to select the only vendors at the airport — the public airport — who could sell NFL merchandise</li></ul><p>And the greed goes on and on. Worth keeping in mind, too, that the new Minneapolis stadium is costing about $500 million in taxpayer money with a sweetheart deal for the owners. Last year I said I was amazed that anybody would volunteer for the NFL. Now, it's simple to declare: If you people in Arizona volunteer for this season's Super Bowl, you're suckers.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
