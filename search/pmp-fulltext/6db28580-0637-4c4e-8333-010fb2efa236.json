Those plates are also unusual in that they're horizontal, which creates much higher risks than vertical plates like the ones under California.</p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_no_border cta_align-right cta_icon-engagement cta_bg-white\" data-entity-id=\"79704\" data-entity-title=\" Facebook event Helping Nepal\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-79704\" class=\"node node-story-act story-act-cta story-act-nid-79704 cta-type-external-link cta-style-suggest clearfix\" about=\"/node/79704\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/79704\">Story Act: Facebook event Helping Nepal</a></h2>\n<p>    <span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Story Act: Facebook event Helping Nepal\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    How can I help?  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-teaser\">\n    Many of you have been impacted by the earthquake that has rocked Nepal and surrounding areas.

In such mountainous territory, the most dangerous areas are the only ones fit for human habitation.</p>\n<p>And the danger is far from over. In addition to the large aftershocks that have hit Nepal in the days after the first earthquake, Bilham says other areas of the Himalayas are also long overdue for major quakes. Bhutan and the Indian regions of Sikkim and Indian-administered Kashmir in particular are storing up huge amounts of pressure, he says.</p>\n<p>\"We know from GPS measurements in these locations that the spring is being wound-up,\" Bilham says. \"There is no avoiding a future earthquake. It’s going to happen.”</p>\n<p>For now, both men hope that Saturday's quake will serve as a wake-up call — and that the next region to be hit will be prepared in time.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/m1RHQhvziB0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-04-27%2Fnepal-preparedness-and-geology-place-holder&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/04272015_03_CMS.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0427201503cmsmp3"}]}
