But we have been very selective on what we&#8217;ve reported.&#8221; Hessendahl added, &#8220;for us the story is not about what one person says about another, or the status of a script of a film project and so forth. The story is really about this attack and what it means going forward for one of Hollywood&#8217;s most powerful studios.&#8221;</p><ul><li><strong>Re/code:</strong> <a href=\"https://recode.net/2014/12/01/heres-what-we-know-about-north-koreas-cyberwar-army/\" target=\"_blank\">Here’s What We Know About North Korea’s Cyberwar Army</a></li></ul><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpyVENBPj5c\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://recode.net/author/arik-hesseldahl/\" target=\"_blank\">Arik Hesseldahl</a></strong>, senior editor at the tech news site <a href=\"http://recode.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Re/code</a>.
