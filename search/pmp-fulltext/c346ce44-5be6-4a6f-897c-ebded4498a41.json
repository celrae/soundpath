And because they’ve been such a successful company, they’ve really set the tone in a lot of ways for the competition.

And all of the floor tiles in the visitor center, which was actually one of the first stores that Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, opened—all of the tiles were mismatched. The colors were off. And Alan Dranow, who oversees the visitor center, pointed them out to me, and explained that they were mismatched because Sam Walton got a good deal on the tiles from the contractor. He told me, “I point to that as a very first example of EDLC, which is Every Day Low Cost, which is how we get to EDLP, which is Every Day Low Prices, which is our pricing strategy.”</p>\n<p>...I heard it multiple times when I was at the headquarters... And you can look at the equation in two different ways. When I talked to Karrie Denniston of the Walmart Foundation, she sees this as one of the key ways that Walmart helps low income Americans.</p>\n<p>She told me “One of the greatest assets that we provide to local communities is often being there, being a grocer that can bring safe, affordable nutritious products in to areas that may not even have had access to them before.”</p>\n<p>But of course remember that equation: \"EDLC = EDLP.\" To get to those everyday low prices, you need everyday low costs, and one of those costs is the cost of labor.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Gura: Some people have argued—and indeed we’ve seen them argue this on the comment section on the website—that Walmart could just raise wages, and I wonder why they haven’t done that—why they’ve decided not to?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Clark: Well, Walmart is a business. They have reasons why they think their approach is the best thing for their bottom line, and their share holders. And then there are questions about well, if you raised wages would that increase prices, and by how much?

But the question is how do we get there? How could we kick start the economy so that businesses aren’t even necessarily getting pressured in to raising their wages higher, but that they <em>need to</em> because there are a lot of people with a lot of skills who can demand a lot for the work they’re doing?</p>\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"257531\",\"view_mode\":\"primary_image\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"primary_image\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Marketplace reporter Krissy Clark\",\"field_description[und][0][value]\":\"Marketplace reporter Krissy Clark talking with volunteers at a Foodbank in Ohio.\",\"field_description[und][0][format]\":\"full_html\",\"field_byline_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_migration_notes[und][0][value]\":\"\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"styles file-styles embed_display media-element file-primary-image\",\"id\":\"styles-0-0\"}}]]</p></div>","itags":["c346ce445be6a6fa97c6ebded4498a41","PMP:Marketplace_PMP","Marketplace"],"published":"2014-04-03T21:42:17+00:00","byline":"David Gura","teaser":"Wal-mart, food stamps, and listener responses.","contenttemplated":"[{\"content\":\"<p><strong><em>David Gura: Your story has generated a lot of <a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/apmmarketplace?\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">listener response</a>. One comment that came in pretty early on is &apos;Should we be shocked by this—by the way the system works?&apos;</em></strong></p>\",\"type\":\"text/html\"},{\"type\":\"text/html\",\"content\":\"<p><em><strong>Krissy Clark: </strong></em>Yeah, and my point isn’t at all to decide if you or any of the listeners should be shocked by this.
