So it seemed only fair to indulge in a little discussion of what this year's festival was actually like, complete with scads of music recommendations.</p><p>For that purpose, we didn't have to look far for our guest panelist: Katie Presley has been a big part of NPR Music's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/sxsw/\">SXSW coverage</a> since before this time last year, and has spent additional years covering the festival (among many other topics) for <a href=\"https://bitchmedia.org/\">Bitch Media</a>. From her home base in Austin, she writes loads of entries in NPR's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/98679384/first-listen\">First Listen</a> series, in addition to being close with the entire <em>Pop Culture Happy Hour</em> gang — more on that in the first minute or two of this week's show.</p><p>Katie and I take turns praising some of the festival's highlights: Her picks in this episode can be found <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/392890850/little-simz\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/03/08/390259651/first-listen-chastity-belt-time-to-go-home\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/392891262/genevieve\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/99737159/tanya-tagaq-gillis\">here</a>, while mine can be found <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/395275152/stromae\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://sonichits.com/video/Count_This_Penny/Shoebox_Scene\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2015/03/25/395106557/sxsw-2015-wrap-up-our-favorite-discoveries-and-memorable-moments\">here</a>. (Also, it would be silly of me not to point out that you can <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/03/03/390053158/the-austin-100-a-sxsw-2015-mix\">download many of our picks</a> as part of The Austin 100 — the <a href=\"http://apps.npr.org/austin/\">stream</a> will be up for a whole additional year, but we pull the free downloads on April 2, so get cracking!)</p><p>Then it's on to a discussion of hometown cliches in pop culture. Katie currently lives in Austin, grew up in Seattle, and has lived in Portland and Los Angeles, so she knows a little something about seeing people make art about places she's lived. We talk <em>Friday Night Lights</em>, as well as <em>Portlandia</em>, America's No. 1 party school, a fountain in Farragut Square, the fictional town of Pawnee and more.</p><p>Finally, as always, we close with What's Making Us Happy this week. I sing the praises of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2015/03/23/394830390/watch-5-late-night-lullabies-from-sxsw\">a new SXSW tradition</a>, as well as <a href=\"http://projects.scpr.org/marchmadness/2015/\">a narrow defeat</a> for <em>Pop Culture Happy Hour</em> and a <a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/article/carrie-brownstein-has-memoir-coming-out-october-216722\">forthcoming memoir</a> I'm likely to actually read. Glen is happy to hear about the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2015/03/24/395087241/here-comes-the-x-files-back-for-more-mulder-more-scully-and-more\">coming return</a> of a TV institution, and at least partially credits <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/kumail-nanjianis-x-files-files/id885275285?mt=2\">this great podcast</a> — for more on the subject, here's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2015/03/26/395347008/small-batch-edition-talking-x-files-with-kumail-nanjiani\">our Small Batch</a> from Thursday — and closes with some words about <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1807165/\">this Australian TV show</a>. Katie revels in the brilliant work of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/161375944/ann-powers\">a magnificent NPR Music colleague</a> (and, by \"magnificent,\" I mean, \"obviously not Bob Boilen, Robin Hilton or Stephen Thompson\") and gushes about <a href=\"http://www.lilykingbooks.com/book/euphoria/\">a book</a> she couldn't put down. And Linda discusses <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12z7ySwOes3358zofRlwcnE5EGraoE-SNSdCtyBmnbr4/viewform\">a surprising way</a> for you to contribute your talents to <em>Pop Culture Happy Hour</em>, as well as <a href=\"http://okbjgm.weebly.com/lost\">this long read</a> about a much-discussed TV show.</p><p>Find us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pchh\">Facebook</a> or follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nprpchh\">Twitter</a>, or reach out individually to <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/idislikestephen\">me</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nprmonkeysee\" target=\"_blank\">Linda</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ghweldon\" target=\"_blank\">Glen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/loveismaroon\">Katie</a>, producer <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jessica_reedy\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica</a> and pal <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/mikekatzif\" target=\"_blank\">Mike</a>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
