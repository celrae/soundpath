Strings & Hammers is a twist of the traditional piano trio with violin and cello. Founded by Eunmi Ko, Sini Virtanen, and Julia Keller, the ensemble has the unusual instrumentation of piano, violin, and double bass. The members met each other at the Eastman School of Music while they were graduate students there. They shared the common interest in chamber music and new music, and naturally, they started playing together in 2013. The ensemble explores chamber music repertoire of the twentieth and twenty-first century and commissions works from emerging composers. Join Bethany Cagle for music and conversation on Classical WSMR.","itags":["npr_api","387408176"],"contentencoded":"<p><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 MPX.
