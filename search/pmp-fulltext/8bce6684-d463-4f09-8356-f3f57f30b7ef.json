It goes hard like chalk. And once its in there its hard to get it out.&#8221;</p><p>Rance say a massive 15-ton fatberg in the London suburb of Kingston required Thames Water to close down and dig up the roads for six months. Rance says the company spends £ 1 million every month to deal with fatbergs.</p><p>&#8220;We are working to get a flushability standard that will go worldwide &#8212; to make sure that anything that has &#8216;flushable&#8217; on it &#8212; actually meets the breaking down standards, so that it won&#8217;t clog and wrap around the sewer machinery  and break it,&#8221; Rance said.</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>We treat the toilet like a magic portal. <div class=\"pullquoteauth\">&ndash; Craig Rance</div></p><p></div></p><p>He says this is not just a London problem and reminds people only two things should go down the toilet:</p><p>&#8220;Only toilet paper and human waste,&#8221; Rance said. &#8220;We treat the toilet like a magic portal.&#8221;</p><p>Rance says flushable wipes have become popular as cleaning products, makeup removers and for personal hygiene &#8212; replacing toilet paper.
