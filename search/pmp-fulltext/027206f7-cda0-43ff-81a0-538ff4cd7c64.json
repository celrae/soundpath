That's something very important to keep in mind. A lot of financial experts say you should be very wary of co-signing a loan, even with a loved one, because of this. It's going to get you on the hook as well. There are some other implications. For example, if you co-sign a loan for your parents, that's going to end up on your credit report.

Generally speaking, a lot of experts say when you're in your sunset years, you should need about roughly 70 percent of your current income on a monthly or an annually basis to cover your nut.
