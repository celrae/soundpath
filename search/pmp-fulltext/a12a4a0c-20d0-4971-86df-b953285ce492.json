Jimmy Buffet, “Cheeseburger in Paradise”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Joshua Epstein:</strong> Even though Jimmy Buffet has a good career selling chips and flip flops . he once upon a time made music. He has a song called “Cheeseburger in Paradise”.</p>\n<br />\n<p>The low point in my music career revolves around Cheeseburger in Paradise. I used to do cover shows to pay the bills between tours. There was a time I was playing the lunch hour at a Mongolian Barbeque and the manager came over and said,”Can you learn some Jimmy Buffet? Can you do Cheeseburger in paradise?”</p>\n<br />\n<p>I got to the part there is the breakdown when he says “I like mine with lettuce and tomato”.

Having a personal anecdote that you can easily draw upon is a nice thing, and being able to reveal the most uncomfortable moments of your life endears you to people, thereby bringing you closer.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>2. Leonard Cohen, “Lover, Lover, Lover”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Daniel Zott:</strong> Speaking of a troubadour let’s move on to another troubadour. For the second song we are going to play Leonard Cohen called “Lover, Lover, Lover, Lover.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Joshua Epstein:</strong> Leonard Cohen is one of the most cutting artists. He can say like four words and it just breaks your heart.It’s also just a catchy chorus and you can let it go and not really have to notice it, which is kind of nice when you are having a dinner party.</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/NfqNb28z-Hk\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Joshua Epstein:</strong> Sometimes it seems like he is writing a love song, but you never know whether he is talking to God or not. It seems like he’s talking to God a lot in his writing.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Daniel Zott:</strong> So maybe by playing the song we are saying the prayer for dinner, “Let’s bless the food,” in a way.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>3. John Lennon, “Cleanup Time”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Daniel Zott:</strong> The worst time after a meal is cleaning up. My dad to motivate us would always but on a song by John Lennon called “Clean Up Time.” So I think that would be a song I’d put on at the end of the night just as a subliminal message to all my guests, “Hey, maybe you want to help me clean up.” Which probably isn’t appropriate when you are hosting a dinner party.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Joshua Epstein:</strong> Subliminally, now when I want you to clean up the van I’m just going to put on “Clean Up Time.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Daniel Zott:</strong> There you go. I’ll probably have a knee-jerk reaction and start cleaning things up.</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/2c8zSKiP5go\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Daniel Zott:</strong> It is so ridiculous to me. I always wondered what was he thinking? Was he really that inspiring? Like, maybe he was trying to motivate his kids so he wrote a song?</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Joshua Epstein:</strong> I think he was trying to get off heroin, to be honest.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Daniel Zott:</strong> Wow, that’s heavier. I never thought of it in that way.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>4. Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr., “War Zone”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Joshua Epstein:</strong> I don’t like to play any music I have made at a dinner party but if you wanted to listen to it on the ride home I don’t think we would be opposed at all. You could put on “War Zone” from our record, I think that’s a great soundtrack for driving home.</p>\n<br />\n<p>You don’t have to necessarily deal with life-or-death situations all the time, and I think it’s kind of interesting to take a character and put them into that kind of situation, to see how the character reacts.</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"http://teamcoco.com/embed/v/53442\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<br /></div>","published":"2013-08-30T06:23:52+00:00","itags":["PMP:The_Dinner_Party_Download_PMP","The Dinner Party Download","The Dinner Party Download 2013-08-30","a12a4a0c20d097106dfcb953285ce492"],"description":"Joshua Epstein: Hi, I am Joshua Epstein and with me is Daniel Zott, and we are Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr..
