(If you're nostalgic, you can listen to our affectionate review of <em>The Heat</em> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2013/07/05/199058148/pop-culture-happy-hour-the-heat-is-on-so-come-on-down\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. It's also the episode with a whole segment on <em>The Price Is Right</em>. Happy Friday!)</p><p>We talk about a lot of things <em>Spy </em>gets right, but more than that, we wind up in an extended conversation about pitfalls it somehow manages to avoid: jokes not made, assumptions not entertained, story beats not hit. In the end, we just liked it, and we thought it was funny. (And while Audie is not a calling-out kind of person and didn't identify the piece on alleged humiliations of McCarthy, it's an argument worth reading and you can find it <a href=\"http://defamer.gawker.com/a-brief-list-of-ways-melissa-mccarthys-character-is-hum-1708852831\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. I don't agree with it, but I get the concern.)</p><p>In our second segment, jumping off the Feig/McCarthy collaboration (to be repeated in the upcoming <em>Ghostbusters</em> reboot), we talk about those director/actor pairings that repeat across films. Is it really a matter of muses and inspiration? Is it aesthetics? Is it just people who like each other? It's hard to tell, but we try to comb through some of the possibilities.</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen acknowledges that he is happy about the sheer weirdness of the box office returns for a recent love letter to an unlikely target. Glen is happy about a book <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2015/06/05/410601773/floating-eyeballs-trained-bees-history-s-most-cringeworthy-crusaders\" target=\"_blank\">he recently reviewed</a> for Monkey See and <a href=\"https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/drawn-quarterly-25\" target=\"_blank\">another one</a> we hope he will soon.
