Young Fathers' hip-hop-infused poetry is intense; you can hear that on the group's new album, <em>White Men Are Black Men Too. </em></p><p>Translating that intensity was a challenge for Young Fathers at the Tiny Desk. Full-on drums and electronics weren't going to happen on this day, so the group's members chose another path — a quieter, more contemplative path — and just two songs made the cut, spanning only four minutes. It's a brief but powerful introduction to their poetry and their possibilities.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"Am I Not Your Boy\"</li><li>\"Only Child\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Maggie Starbard; Audio Engineer: Brian Jarboe; Videographers: Morgan McCloy, Maggie Starbard; Assistant Producer:</em> <em>Nick Michael; photo Maggie Starbard/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
