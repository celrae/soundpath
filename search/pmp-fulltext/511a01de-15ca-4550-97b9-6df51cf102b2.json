It's my desk and I've seen almost all of the nearly 400 concerts up close. So you'd think this would be easy. Moon Hooch have made it a lot easier.</p><p>Up there with the ear-shaking voice of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/133687905/adele-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\">Adele</a>, the desk dancing of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/12/03/128111544/gogol-bordello-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\">Gogol Bordello</a>, the stripped down version of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/05/18/126669279/phoenix-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenix</a> — not to mention magic moments with <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/167447820/alt-j-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\">Alt-J</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/265772089/angel-olsen-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\">Angel Olsen</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/168632210/lucius-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\">Lucius</a> and more — Moon Hooch blew me away with just two saxes and a drummer. Their music is a mix of the best jazz, EDM and rock have to offer. It's out there, it's danceable and you may find yourself feeling a sense of reckless abandon!</p><p>The band is saxophonists Mike Wilbur and Wenzl McGowen, and drummer James Muschler. They all studied in New York at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, and every single moment of every song I've ever seen them perform has been full throttle. They call their music \"cave music,\" taking the best elements of electronica — the brutal stops, starts and shifts — and performing those unnaturally precise hairpin turns organically by blowing on horns and banging on drums. This for the boldness in all of us.
