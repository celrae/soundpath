The results of that vote are still unknown. Even if the players voted to join a union, legal actions could stall that from taking place for months or even years.</p><p>But the vote has stirred debate over whether college athletes deserve to be paid.</p><p>University of Delaware president <strong>Patrick Harker</strong> is a vocal opponent of paying college athletes.</p><p>He tells <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson that 90 percent of colleges and universities don&#8217;t make money from their sports programs. Harker says he would have to shut down the University of Delaware&#8217;s varsity sports program if student athletes won the right to be paid.</p><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let the exception be the rule,&#8221; Harker said. &#8220;There are those programs that make a lot of money, but they are not the majority of Division I athletics. And I say this not just as a university president, but I was a student athlete too, many years ago, with many injuries ago. And I learned a lot out of that experience and I don&#8217;t want us to lose those opportunities for this generation of student athletes.&#8221;</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/opinion/student-athletes-shouldnt-unionize.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick Harker&#8217;s New York Times op-ed &#8220;Student Athletes Shouldn’t Unionize&#8221;</a></li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.udel.edu/president/bio.html\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick Harker</a></strong>, president of the University of Delaware.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 WBUR-FM.
