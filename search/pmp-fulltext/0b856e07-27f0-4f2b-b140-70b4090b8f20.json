In fact, \"Head\" and \"Verlaine Shot Rimbaud\" (both of which appear on this year's terrific <em>Somewhere Else</em>) pop up back-to-back in this subdued but seething three-song Tiny Desk Concert, which Loveless recorded with the help of her full touring band.</p><p>Loveless follows \"Head\" and \"Verlaine\" with \"Mile High,\" an even newer single (released with a cover of Kesha's \"Blind\" as a B-side) she'd just put out as a 7\" on Record Store Day. Taken together, the three songs — performed, as Loveless notes wryly, with very little audience eye contact — paint a smart, no-nonsense picture of a smart, no-nonsense talent.</p><h5><strong>Set List</strong></h5><ul><li>\"Head\"</li><li>\"Verlaine Shot Rimbaud\"</li><li>\"Mile High\"</li></ul><h5><strong>Credits</strong></h5><p><em>Producers: Denise DeBelius, Stephen Thompson; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Olivia Merrion; Production Assistant: Alex Schelldorf; photo by Alex Schelldorf/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
