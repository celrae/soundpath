So this week, we sat down to chat about <em>Wolf Hall</em>, the prizewinning novel an adaptation of which just started airing on PBS. Barrie and I talk sweating sickness, intrigue, kings, sad stories, and the fact that she is available for all your \"what's going on in this scene\" needs. Seriously. You can <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/bhardymon\" target=\"_blank\">tweet at her</a>. She thinks about Henry's wives a lot.</p><p>Friday, we'll have a whole new show featuring our pal Chris Klimek, the new FX show <em>The Comedians</em>, and a look at cameo appearances. Until then: Barrie has you covered, beheadings-wise.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
