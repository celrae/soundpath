That’s bad news for most churches that still get the bulk of their donations in cash or checks, but more of them are trading their collection baskets for digital devices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston is the mother church of the city’s Catholic Archdiocese and the building costs a lot to maintain. “We’re looking at maybe $1.5 million to keep it from falling in outside,” says Father Kevin O’Leary, rector of the cathedral.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the free clinic, the food pantry, school programs for low-income kids. The church still collects most of its donations in baskets on Sundays in cash or checks, but O’Leary says his congregation is getting younger, and the way parishioners give is changing.</p>\n<p>“People carry less and less cash, myself included,” he explains. “Credit cards are used for everything, and I think, really, it is the reality in the near future if not the present.”</p>\n<p>Just inside the main entrance of the cathedral I ran into Joey LaMartina, who stopped by the gift store.

They start at $1,500, plus a set-up cost and a $40 monthly licensing fee. About 900 churches are using them nationwide and Baker says sales have tripled since the company rolled out an iPad version last fall.</p>\n<p>Some models print receipts for people to put in the collection basket so they don’t feel guilty when it passes by.

Brian Kluth studies religious philanthropy for an annual “State of the Plate” survey.
