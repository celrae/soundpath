It comes up from time to time as a strange example of perplexing television, but we would never let it run roughshod over an entire episode.</p><p>We will, however, seal it tightly in its own Small Batch Edition of the podcast for those of you who, like us, find yourselves weirdly drawn to this much-tweeted-about, much-scoffed-at, often baffling show that started a new season Monday night with a three-hour (!) premiere. We'll talk about the man at the center of the fury, the state from which he hails (which the show talks about as if it were located on the moon), the women trying to win his heart, the influence of booze and booze-shaming, and lots more.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
