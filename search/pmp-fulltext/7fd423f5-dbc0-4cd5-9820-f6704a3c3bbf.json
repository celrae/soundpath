It&#8217;s about the family and there is no hot button issue in the Catholic Church &#8230; that doesn&#8217;t fall under that rubric.&#8221;</p><p>Pope Francis has invited lay people from around the world to give testimony at the meeting.</p><p>&#8220;He decided to invite 12 married couples to give the bishops a crash course in the reality of what family life is like,&#8221; Allen said. &#8220;And it has been striking that these married couples have brought up some conversations that you just don&#8217;t hear in assemblies of celibate male bishops.&#8221;</p><p>While Allen says the Synod won&#8217;t result in any doctrinal changes, there could be changes in the application of doctrine. At the very least, Allen says exposing the bishops to different family organizations would let them be &#8220;better equipped to talk about these issues with people who are living in situations [the bishops] would consider irregular,&#8221; such as being gay or cohabitating.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>John Allen</strong>, an associate editor for <a href=\"http://www.cruxnow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Crux</a>.
