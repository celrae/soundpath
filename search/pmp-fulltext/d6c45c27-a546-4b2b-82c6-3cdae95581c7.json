In 1979, she finished the then-longest swim in history: 102.5 miles from Bimini to Florida. At age 60, she began preparing for her <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/09/02/218207861/diana-nyad-in-homestretch-of-cuba-florida-swim\">most ambitious swim</a>: 110 miles from Cuba to Florida.
