A lot of diesels run at 20 or 30 percent, because that's the load they're carrying...well, you waste fuel, and pretty soon the generators clog and stop working.</p>\n<p>What you need is a micro-smart-grid robust enough to operate in a really hostile environment.

It's been redesigning the basic combat outpost, and the new designs are assembled and built by a company called Berg based in Spokane.</p>\n<p>\"And that's when I talk about energy efficiency, no one else has done that,\" says Berg's CEO, Don Myers. Berg makes camps for extreme needs: disaster relief, mining, the military. The systems for what the army is testing now, he says, are the most efficient camps in the world</p>\n<p>\"Other ones have little bits and pieces and little satellite operations that are under very restrictive conditions here in the states,\" he says. \"They have certain types of water and power and all sorts of engineers and technicians tweaking it and making it work.

Instead of six generators limping toward the junkyard at half speed, the smart grid connects them all to each other, and then loads all the demand onto one generator until it needs another.

A billet container is a living space for 10 people.</p>\n<p>\"It comes with a small kitchen with a dining room.\"</p>\n<p>Well, in another container...the X-camp has to feed its 100 soldiers. And care for them, so there's also one for sanitation.</p>\n<p>\"And we have a power grid. It supplies the power for the camp.\"</p>\n<p>Yeah. The grid. Because a smart-grid cuts fuel needs by at least 50 percent, probably more. That's why they are maniacal about efficiency, and its sometimes-tricky balance.</p>\n<p>\"These are the most energy efficient machines that I believe they make,\" Easterling says.</p>\n<p>Allen Easterling was a soldier for a dozen years, a consultant now for more than a dozen, the lead tech for assembling the X-Camps.
