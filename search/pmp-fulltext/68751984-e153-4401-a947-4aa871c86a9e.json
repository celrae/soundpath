But Swonk says the cost-of-living increase falls short of the inflation that older Americans are actually seeing.</p><p>&#8220;They spend more disproportionately on things like prescription drugs that are going up much more rapidly than the overall. They spend more on shelter and food, which are also going up more rapidly.
