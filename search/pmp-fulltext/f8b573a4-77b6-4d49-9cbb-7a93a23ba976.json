Despite his five albums full of well-loved songs, we asked him to play new material for this Tiny Desk Concert; songs we hadn't yet heard. Earle's new album <em>Single Mothers </em>comes out this week, and here he performs two tracks from that record: \"White Gardenias,\" his nod to Billie Holiday, and \"Burning Pictures.\"</p><p>Based in Nashville, Earle is a strong lyricist with a father, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/18146884/steve-earle\">Steve Earle</a>, who similarly finds strength in perfectly crafted words. The younger Earle is on tour now, playing old and new songs, so here's a taste of his sharp songwriting to tide you over until he comes to your town.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"Burning Pictures\"</li><li>\"When The One You Love Loses Faith In You\"</li><li>\"White Gardenias\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Colin Marshall, Maggie Starbard; photo by Colin Marshall/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
