In the beginning, they really did not like each other. When they would tape the show, they wouldn&#8217;t talk to each other. Later in life, of course, they became like brothers and they actually loved each other by the end of Gene&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p><p><p class=\"gmail_default\"><strong>On director Ava DuVernay&#8217;s relationship with Ebert</strong></p><p><p class=\"gmail_default\">&#8220;I think that she is going to be the first African American woman director nominated for an Academy Award for her movie &#8216;Selma.&#8217; She told me that if Roger had not championed her first movie &#8216;I Will Follow&#8217; that she would not have been given the opportunity to make &#8216;Selma.&#8217; You know, she talked about being this little 8-year-old girl who met Roger. She saw him and she started saying, &#8216;There&#8217;s the thumbs-up man! Come over! Come over!&#8217; And she said Roger was so kind to her and she has a picture of herself with Roger when she was 8-years-old.&#8221;</p><p><p class=\"gmail_default\"><strong>On Ebert&#8217;s life philosophies</strong></p><p><p class=\"gmail_default\">&#8220;For him the movies were not just the movies. The movies really were about life itself. He thought that if you studied movies carefully, then you could get a lesson to let you know what it&#8217;s like to be a person of another race, of another gender, of another sexual orientation.&#8221;</p><p><p class=\"gmail_default\">&#8220;When he would write blogs about different situations, he would get comments saying, &#8216;Oh, just stick to movie reviews. How dare you have an opinion on politics or race or religion.&#8217; And he would say, &#8216;I am a citizen first and a movie reviewer second.'&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/contributors/chaz-ebert\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Chaz Ebert</strong></a>, wife of the late film critic Roger Ebert.
