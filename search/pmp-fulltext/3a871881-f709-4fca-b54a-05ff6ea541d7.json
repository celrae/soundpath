The conflict drew in country after country and grew to an unprecedented scale. An estimated 9 million combatants lost their lives and more than 21 million were wounded in what came to be known as The Great War and, eventually, World War I.</p><p>Among the dead and the survivors were musicians. We've been listening to some of their creations. The extraordinary level of destruction inspired them in myriad ways. Some composers captured the war's violence while others seemed to counteract it by writing music that soothed. Still others came back wounded yet persevered. And all these years later, the war continues to resonate in works like the 2012 Pulitzer Prize-winning opera <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/151211677/hear-the-opera-that-won-the-pulitzer\" target=\"_blank\">Silent Night</a> by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2013/08/05/208280751/a-pulitzer-winner-asks-why-write-symphonies\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Puts</a>.</p><p>Have a favorite piece of music inspired by World War I?
