When a country is faced with recession,&nbsp;it has&nbsp;two choices -- stimulus, or austerity. Pump more money into your government, grow your debt, and hope that you're creating enough jobs along the way to work your way out of the slump. Or you can start making cuts to slow the amount of money your country will&nbsp;need to borrow. \"In the long term, economists think that having less debt is going to be better for the economy.
