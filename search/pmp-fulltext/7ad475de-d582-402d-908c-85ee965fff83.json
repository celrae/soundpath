We’ll look at what it means for readers, for writers and the book business.</p><p>Gigantic Amazon controls a huge portion of all book sales in America now, and right now it’s using that power “bare knuckles” with one of the country’s biggest book publishers, Hachette.  If you’re looking for the latest from J.K. Rowling or James Patterson or Stephen Colbert on Amazon, good luck.  The Internet giant is playing real hardball in negotiations over who gets what in e-book sales.  At one level, it’s just business.  At another, it’s about how the Internet can concentrate power, in this case in the realm of books – ideas. This hour On Point:  Amazon versus the publishers, and the future of ideas in America.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: right\"><strong>&#8211; Tom Ashbrook</strong></p><h4>Guests</h4><p><a title=\"Jeffrey Trachtenberg\" href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/A/biography/7975\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jeffrey Trachtenberg</strong></a>, book publishing reporter for<em> The Wall Street Journal. </em>(<a title=\"@JeffreyT1\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffreyT1\" target=\"_blank\">@JeffreyT1</a>)</p><p><a title=\"Roxana Robinson\" href=\"http://www.roxanarobinson.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Roxana Robinson</strong></a>, novelist and author of &#8220;<a title=\"Sparta\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sparta-Novel-Roxana-Robinson/dp/1250050170/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1401905591&sr=1-1&keywords=sparta+roxana+robinson\" target=\"_blank\">Sparta</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a title=\"Cost\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Cost-Novel-Roxana-Robinson/dp/0312428464/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1401905603&sr=1-1&keywords=cost+roxana+robinson\" target=\"_blank\">Cost</a>,&#8221; &#8220;<a title=\"Sweetwater\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sweetwater-A-Novel-Roxana-Robinson/dp/0812967348/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y\" target=\"_blank\">Sweetwater</a>&#8221; and many others.
