He has been in jail for 14 months, accused of leading a protest against President Nicolas Maduro in 2014.</p>\n<p>\"We have 80 political prisoners in Venezuela, including a mayor, students and my husband,\" Tintori says. \"We don't have a rule of law in Venezuela.

But she wants to see the US, in particular, put more pressure on leaders in her country.</p>\n<p>\"Human rights don't have borders,\" she says. \"We need to work [under] the same flag.\"</p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-04-10%2Fwife-jailed-opposition-venezuela-talks-human-rights-summit-americas&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/04102015_05.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0410201505mp3"}]}
