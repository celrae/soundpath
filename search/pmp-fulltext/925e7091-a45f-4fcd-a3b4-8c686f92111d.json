Exactly how dads do that, however, is largely a mystery. Thousands of studies have sliced and diced the benefits for children of a close, nurturing bond with Mom. Researchers have a harder time analyzing the ways fathers interact with children, such as rough-and-tumble play.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"SciAm Dads\" href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-dads-influence-teens-happiness/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Scientific American</strong>: How Dads Influence Teens&#8217; Happiness</a> &#8212; &#8220;In 2011 administrators at Frayser High School in Memphis, Tenn., came to a disturbing realization. About one in five of its female students was either pregnant or had recently given birth. City officials disputed the exact figures, but they admitted that Frayser had a problem. The president of a local nonprofit aimed at helping girls blamed the disturbing rate of teen pregnancy on television.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"NYT Do Fathers Matter?\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/books/do-fathers-matter-shows-why-they-do.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>New York Times</strong>: Relevant? Nurturing? Well, So’s Your Old Man</a> &#8212; &#8220;When our young daughters first decided to play on top of our Honda minivan, parked in our driveway, my wife was worried. But to me, it seemed no less safe than chasing a ball that frequently ended up in the street. And they loved the height, the novelty, the danger. So I let them stay. They never fell. And with the summer weather here, playing on the car is once again keeping them occupied for hours.&#8221;</p><h4>Read An Excerpt Of &#8220;Do Fathers Matter?&#8221; By Paul Raeburn</h4><div class=\"scribd_embed\"><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"//www.scribd.com/embeds/229238453/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-222rwz8dhtwc4u8zig8c\" data-auto-height=\"true\"data-aspect-ratio=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 WBUR-FM.
