It truly reminds people of their childhoods near the lakes near their cottages, or camping or hiking in the wilderness. I think it’s the bird most associated with Canada’s beauty.”</p>\n<p>The snowy owl is holding down second place, and Walker admits he's a fan of the current third place bird — even though he's supposed to be strictly neutral.</p>\n<p>“I’m going for the gray jay,\" he says. \"It never leaves Canada in the winter, and it actually breeds in the dead of winter, which means it’s pretty tough.”</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"3309\" width=\"4802\" alt=\"Gray Jay resting on a branch in Banff National Park along the route to Sulfur Mountain.\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/Gray_Jay_in_Late_Spring.jpg\" title=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p class=\"mw-mmv-credit mw-mmv-ttf-container mw-mmv-ttf-normal\">Gray Jay resting on a branch in Banff National Park along the route to Sulfur Mountain.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Zachaysan/Wiki Commons</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>But what about the world-famous — or infamous — <a href=\"http://www.canada-goose.com/\">Canada goose</a>? It's in <em>fourth</em> place.</p>\n<p>“The Canada goose is a polarizing bird. People either love it or they hate it,” Walker says. “It’s found across a lot of the world, which some voters are saying is a good reason to call it Canada’s national bird — simply because of the name.”</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"1275\" width=\"1914\" alt=\"A Canada Goose flying near Oceanville, New Jersey, USA.\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/Branta_canadensis_-near_Oceanville%2C_New_Jersey%2C_USA_-flying-8.jpg\" title=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>A Canada Goose flying near Oceanville, New Jersey, USA.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Daniel D'Auria/Wiki Commons</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>And while the Canada goose is running behind, voting is open until the end of the year.
