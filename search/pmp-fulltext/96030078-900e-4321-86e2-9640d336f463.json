It was a parody of late ’70s/early ’80s summer camp comedies. And it became a cult hit.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Michael Ian Black:</strong> It did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> And now, Netflix is releasing a series of prequels around this, right?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Michael Ian Black:</strong> Yes. It’s an eight-episode prequel, the same cast is in it, but we’re now 15 years older, playing ourselves about three months younger.</p>\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WHAS_01_00699r-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Image Credit: Saeed Adyani/Netflix\" />The cast of “Wet Hot American Summer” 15 years later.

And in fact, the guy who co-wrote it and produced it and is one of dearest friends, Michael Showalter, in the time since the first “Wet Hot American Summer,” has gained maybe 80 pounds! <em>&nbsp;[laughs uproariously]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:&nbsp;</strong>You took such delight in saying that.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Michael Ian Black:</strong> Oh, <em>nothing</em> makes me happier than his gut.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> So you’re doing this prequel. It does bring up the question: &nbsp;Since “The State,” or even since “Wet Hot” in 2001, how has comedy changed? The internet feels like it’s changed comedy tremendously.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Michael Ian Black:</strong> It has. And I would say it has sort of gone in two different tracks, kind of simultaneously. Both of which were always there, but weren’t as prominent as they are now. &nbsp;When we made that movie, I think the most popular kind of comedy was the Adam Sandler-esque sort of big, dumb&nbsp;—&nbsp;I don’t mean that pejoratively — but <em>really</em> dumb and stupid comedy.</p>\n<br />\n<p>And I think since then, you have your kind of Judd Apatow / “Girls”&nbsp;/ “Transparent,” very rooted, real-life, almost dramedy-comedy. “Louie,” the TV show, is a little bit of that.</p>\n<br />\n<p>And then on the other end, you’ve got really kind of absurd, surreal stuff that is sort of more cable and internet. But you see some of it on the big screen; like “Anchorman” I think is a good example of that. And the kind of middle-of-the-road Adam Sandler stuff has fallen off a little bit.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Which, believe me, Adam is going to come back bigger and better than ever. He’s a dear friend. I’ve never met him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong>&nbsp;But I mean, when “The State” came out, people just weren’t even aware of that many sketch comedy troupes. &nbsp;And now, if you’ve got a sketch comedy troupe, you can have a podcast tomorrow.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Michael Ian Black:</strong> Yeah. You don’t necessarily even need a sketch comedy troupe to have a podcast tomorrow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, that’s true…</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Michael Ian Black:&nbsp;</strong>I mean look at you guys.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5-9-15-DPD-098-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Photo Credit: Jayme Halbritter\" />Photo Credit: Jayme Halbritter<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you, thank you. Coming back later for etiquette, Michael Ian Black, ladies and gentleman!</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Before we let you go, we want to ask you our two standard questions. &nbsp;And the first question is: what question are you tired of being asked in interviews?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Michael Ian Black:</strong> Well, I get this a lot. Not necessarily in interviews, but often when I’m on the street it’s: “Hey, were you in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnyCJDYONSU\">‘Kids in the Hall?</a>‘”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Oh, no.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Michael Ian Black:</strong> Which is a sketch comedy troupe from the ’90s that I am recognized for being in <em>far more</em> than the sketch troupe I was <em>actually</em> in. So I get a lot of that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> So our second&nbsp;question, sort of the flip of that: tell us something we don’t know. And this can be about anything, yourself or a piece of trivia.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Michael Ian Black:</strong> Well, there’s <a href=\"http://www.techtimes.com/articles/54134/20150520/crispr-cas9-what-exactly-can-it-do.htm\" target=\"_blank\">a new process called CRISPR</a>. Which is a method of copying and pasting strands of misbehaving DNA. So you can actually insert a protein into a body of a living organism, snip out the part of DNA that you don’t want, replace it with a piece of DNA that you <em>do</em> want, and thus change your genetic code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Your <em>own</em> genetic code?</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> You can do that to yourself? Like get rid of cancer?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote data-pullquote=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Michael Ian Black:</strong> Eventually yes, yes. They’re doing it on mice and smaller organisms right now. In China, they’re testing it on people. <q>Bioethicists are saying, “Hold on a second, guys…”</q></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong>&nbsp;“Maybe we should think for a moment.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Michael Ian Black:</strong>&nbsp;“We might want to think about this for a second.” But in China they’re like, “Full steam ahead!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br /></div>","audio":[{"type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5-9-15-DPD-104.jpg"},{"type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5-9-15-DPD-095.jpg"},{"type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"width":null,"height":null,"crop":"primary"},"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5-9-15-DPD-096.jpg"},{"type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"width":null,"height":null,"crop":"primary"},"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5-9-15-DPD-098.jpg"},{"meta":{"width":null,"crop":"primary","height":null},"type":"image/jpeg","href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5-9-15-DPD-099.jpg"},{"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5-9-15-DPD-0951.jpg","meta":{"width":null,"crop":"primary","height":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WHAS_01_00699r.jpg","meta":{"width":null,"crop":"primary","height":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MIC-GOH.jpg","meta":{"width":null,"crop":"primary","height":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"width":null,"crop":"primary","height":null},"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MIB-2.jpg"},{"format":"MP3","type":"audio/mpeg","meta":{"api":{"href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm_audio:/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2015/05/22/0522goh","type":"application/json"},"duration":583,"duration_hms":"00:09:43"},"href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2015/05/22/0522goh_128.mp3"}]}
