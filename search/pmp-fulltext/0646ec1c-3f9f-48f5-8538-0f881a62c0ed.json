The report argues the U.S. is failing to prepare millions of young people to lead successful lives because high schools focus too narrowly on an academic, college-prep approach to education.</p>\n<p>Symonds says there are millions of good <a href=\"http://cew.georgetown.edu/recovery2020\" target=\"_blank\">jobs</a> that don’t require a Bachelor’s degree.&nbsp;Many of those jobs are in so-called “middle-skill” occupations, like construction manager and computer technician. These jobs tend to require professional licenses and certificates, but not college. &nbsp;According to the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, the median certificate holder <a href=\"https://georgetown.app.box.com/s/81fpcp15916ydl9gpgn8\" target=\"_blank\">out-earns</a> more than a quarter of people who have Bachelor’s degrees.</p>\n<h2>Straight to college — or not</h2>\n<p>Thirty-four percent of 2013 high school graduates were <em>not</em> enrolled in college as of Oct. 2013</p>\n<div class=\"chart-text\">\n<div class=\"chart\">\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row\">\n<td>Enrolled</td>\n<td>\n<div>1.96 million</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"otherrow\">\n<td><strong>Not enrolled</strong></td>\n<td>\n<div><strong>1.01 million</strong></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/hsgec.nr0.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Minuteman</strong></p>\n<p>Minuteman Regional High school, a vocational school outside of Boston, offers the kind of education in which, Symonds says, the nation should invest more.
