Some 15 years ago, they were already chipping away at the barriers — both real and perceived — between classical and pop.</p><p>Haimovitz played Bach in barrooms across America, and O'Riley (who hosts <em><a href=\"http://www.fromthetop.org/\" target=\"_blank\">From The Top</a></em>, NPR's classical radio show for young musicians) began including his own sophisticated transcriptions of songs by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15152697/radiohead\" target=\"_blank\">Radiohead</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/16521017/elliott-smith\" target=\"_blank\">Elliott Smith</a> in his recitals.

The central work, \"The Orchard,\" is a collaboration between <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15680178/philip-glass\" target=\"_blank\">Philip Glass</a> and West African composer Foday Musa Suso. It unfolds like a lullaby, as the piano's rocking bass line provides a mesmerizing foundation for the cello's wistful song high above. Surrounding it are lyricism and outbursts by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15232481/ludwig-van-beethoven\" target=\"_blank\">Beethoven</a>, from his Cello Sonata No. 4 (sounding distinctly 20th century), and a cinematic movement from <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/16318115/leos-jan-cek\" target=\"_blank\">Leoš Janáček</a>'s <em>Pohádka</em>, where heart-melting melodies clash with nervous energy.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>Beethoven: Cello Sonata No. 4 in C - IV.
