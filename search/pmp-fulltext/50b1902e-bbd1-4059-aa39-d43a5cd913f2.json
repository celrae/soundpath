But when the Minnesota woman tried recently to create a Facebook account, she hit a snag. The service's software couldn't handle her advanced age of 113 years old. So she fudged it a bit, and said she was 99.</p><p>To put Stoehr's age in context, we'll remind you: She was born three years before the Wright brothers conducted their historic first flight of an airplane in North Carolina.</p><p>Her story was highlighted recently by <a href=\"http://www.kare11.com/story/news/local/land-of-10000-stories/2014/10/09/anna-stoehr-114-plainview-verizon/17011467/\">KARE 11 TV</a>, which visited Stoehr in Plainview, Minn., shortly before Stoehr's birthday party. She turns 114 Wednesday.</p><p>KARE notes that when Stoehr was born, her family didn't have a telephone or a car â€” or electricity. But she recently got some new gadgets, including an iPad, after her son Harlan, 85, talked about her with a wireless store salesman this summer. The salesman became curious and met her in person after Harlan bought an iPhone.</p><p>Since then, the salesman, Joseph Ramireza, has gotten Stoehr set up for video chats. And he typed a letter for her to send to Facebook to let the company know she couldn't log on. She hasn't heard back, but Stoehr <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100004355955273\">now has an account</a>, along with 31 friends.</p><p>\"That's an aspect of my mom,\" Harlan says. \"She's been curious about everything all her life and continues to be curious about it.\"</p><p>The issue of centenarians having trouble joining Facebook made headlines last year, when <a href=\"http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/Michigan-grandmother-104-says-Facebook-won-t-accept-her-age/18997426\">Marguerite Joseph of Michigan, 104</a>, realized she had to say she was 99 to have an account.</p><p>At the time, the company issued this statement:</p><blockquote><p>\"We've recently discovered an issue whereby some Facebook users may be unable to enter a birthday before 1910. We are working on a fix for this and we apologize for the inconvenience.\"</p></blockquote><p>A look at Facebook's current sign-up page finds that its drop-down menu for users' birthdays doesn't go earlier than 1905.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
