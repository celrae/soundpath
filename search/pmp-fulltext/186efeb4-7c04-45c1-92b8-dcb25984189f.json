Type 2 is a symptom and a disease. Type 1 may have some new answers.</p><p>If diabetes were an infectious disease, the media would be going crazy over it.  Twenty-nine million American adults affected.  The numbers surging, up another nine percent since 2010.  Terrible risks:  stroke, blindness, kidney failure, amputation.  Cost to the US economy – nearly $250 billion a year.  But diabetes isn’t infectious.  Type 1, just five percent of cases, comes on in childhood.  Type 2 &#8211; the big numbers – is practically a lifestyle disease.  Poor diet, obesity, lack of exercise – and millions are at risk.  This hour On Point:  America’s diabetes boom, and what to do about it.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: right\"><strong>&#8211; Tom Ashbrook</strong></p><h4>Guests</h4><p><a title=\"Dr. Robert Goland\" href=\"http://www.nbdiabetes.org/our-clinical-care-team#0\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dr. Robin Goland</strong></a>, professor of clinical medicine and pediatrics at Columbia University.
