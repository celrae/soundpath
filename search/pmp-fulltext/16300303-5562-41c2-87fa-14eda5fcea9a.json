While they racked up swift victories all the way to Iraq&#8217;s western border, the strategy at Baiji was different. A truce allowed some 300 workers to leave the plant a few days after the evacuation of a German technical staff.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"NYT Govt Pensions\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/upshot/why-government-pension-funds-became-addicted-to-risk.html?rref=upshot\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>New York Times</strong>: Why Government Pension Funds Became Addicted to Risk</a> &#8211; &#8221;The volatility of stock returns is why pension funds invested in bonds in the first place. And it’s most likely a driver of the recent rush toward alternative investments, which went from 11 percent of pension portfolios in 2006 to 23 percent in 2012, according to Pew; nearly the entire shift has come at the expense of stocks.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"WaPo SCOTUS\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-rebukes-obama-on-recess-appointments/2014/06/26/e5e4fefa-e831-11e3-a86b-362fd5443d19_story.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Washington Post</strong>: Supreme Court rebukes Obama on recess appointments</a> &#8212; &#8220;While the court was unanimous that Obama’s actions were unlawful, it was badly split on other questions the case raised and narrowly favored an expansive view of the chief executive’s power. Breyer and the court’s liberals, joined by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, read the Constitution to give wide authority to the president to make recess appointments when the Senate was in recess — 10 days is the minimum, they decided. &#8220;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
