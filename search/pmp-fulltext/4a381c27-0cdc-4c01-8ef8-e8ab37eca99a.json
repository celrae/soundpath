Demoulas told several hundred workers Thursday morning in Tewksbury, some of whom shouted &#8220;We love you&#8221; and &#8220;Welcome back&#8221; during a speech that sometimes resembled a political victory speech, and often took on the tones of a rock concert.</p><p>&#8220;I am in awe of what you have all accomplished,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Arthur T. Demoulas was ousted in June by a board of directors controlled by rival cousin Arthur S. Demoulas, causing workers to stage protests. Hundreds of warehouse workers and drivers refused to deliver food, leading to empty shelves and tens of millions in lost revenue. Customers stopped shopping at Market Basket, with some even taping their receipts from competitors in Market Basket store windows.</p><p>Demoulas on Wednesday announced that an agreement has been reached for him to buy for $1.5 billion the 50.5 percent of the company owned by Arthur S.
