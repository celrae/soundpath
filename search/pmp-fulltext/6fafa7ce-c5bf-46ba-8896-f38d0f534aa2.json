Probably because there are so many crosses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>They photographed one of every letter, and then more than one of every letter. And then two years ago, Jera was volunteering at her daughter's school and needed to find the teacher a wedding gift. So she arranged some of the pictures in a frame, spelling out the teacher's new last name.</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong class=\"name\">Jera Deal:</strong> Before we even walked into school with it, I showed the other room mom, who was room mother with me. She ordered nine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>Everybody wanted one. And a month later, they had a business called Sticks and Stones.</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>This is all they make.

You pick out the letters online, they frame them and mail you the piece.</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>Their projected sales for this year: $10 million.</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong class=\"name\">Brad Deal:</strong> It's almost a viral thing in that . . .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>This is Brad . . .</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong class=\"name\">Brad Deal:</strong> Viral growth, because I just had somebody e-mail me today that said, \"You have no idea how many people have seen your piece on our wall and asked for your website.\" And I said, \"Well, our sales show that I kind of have an idea.\" I mean, no I didn't tell her that, but . . .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>It's viral in more than one way. The whole family can't stop seeing letters everywhere. On a recent trip to New York . . .</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong class=\"name\">Brad Deal:</strong> People would walk by on the sidewalk and see me squatting down by this little railing by a building taking a picture on something like a lamp post, you know?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong class=\"name\">Cole:</strong> And thinking he's insane.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong class=\"name\">Brad:</strong> What's wrong with this guy? Yeah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>There's a story like this behind every letter. For example, I asked them if we could bring the camera to a local playground, even though the sky was getting black.
