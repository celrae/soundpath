The 20-minute-long video featured the slick production and graphics used in previous videos released by the group.</p><p>Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh, 26, fell into the hands of the militants in December when his Jordanian F-16 crashed near Raqqa, Syria, the de facto capital of the group&#8217;s self-styled caliphate. He was the first pilot from the U.S.-led coalition battling the group to be captured.</p><p>At a tribal meeting place where the pilot&#8217;s relatives have waited for weeks for word on his fate, chants against Jordan&#8217;s King Abdullah II erupted and some family members wept. An uncle shouted in Arabic: &#8220;I received a phone call from the chief of staff saying God bless his soul.&#8221;</p><p>The pilot&#8217;s father, Safi, was surrounded by family members.</p><p>Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani could not be reached for comment.</p><p>Following militant demands, Jordan&#8217;s government had said it was willing to trade Sajida al-Rishawi, an al-Qaida prisoner, for the pilot, but that it wanted proof of life first. Al-Rishawi faces death in Jordan for her role in triple 2005 hotel bombings that killed 60 people.</p><p>The latest video emerged three days after Japanese journalist Kenji Goto was purportedly beheaded by the militants. The fate of the two captives had been linked but a video of Goto&#8217;s purported slaying released Saturday made no mention of the pilot.</p><p>An audio message last week, also purportedly from the Islamic State group, only said the pilot would be killed if al-Rishawi was not released Thursday, without actually proposing a swap.</p><p>A scroll on Jordan TV said that the pilot was killed on Jan. 3, raising questions over whether any of the hostage negotiations were sincere.</p><p>The video included purported images of the pilot showing signs of having been beaten, including a black eye. At the end of the video he is purportedly shown wearing an orange jumpsuit and standing in an outdoor cage. A masked militant lights a line of fuel leading to the cage.</p><p>The video also threatened other purported Jordanian pilots.</p><p>The Islamic State extremist group, which controls around a third of Syria and neighboring Iraq, has issued a series of grisly videos showing the killing of captives, including two American journalists, an American aid worker and two British aid workers. Tuesday&#8217;s was the first to show a captive being burned alive.</p><p><strong>Seth Jones</strong>, director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at Rand, joins <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Here & Now</em></a>&#8216;s Robin Young to talk more about the news.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.rand.org/about/people/j/jones_seth_g.html\" target=\"_blank\">Seth Jones</a>, </strong>director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at Rand.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
