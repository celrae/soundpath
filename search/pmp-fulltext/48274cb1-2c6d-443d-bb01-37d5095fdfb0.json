But at first glance you don&#39;t notice the pictures also say a ton, especially ones showing a paved road or lights. &quot;It&#39;s unbelievable the small things that I was posting that were meaningless if you were in Canada,&quot; she says. &quot;Why would you take a picture of a light? That&#39;s because we actually have lights here now. The roads are paved. We have buildings. They fascinated people for whatever reason.&quot;</p><p>Her followers span continents and countries. There&#39;s her hometown crowd in Toronto. Others in Scandinavia. More in Nigeria. She wants people to have a positive connotation to the words, Somalia, Mogadishu, and East Africa.</p><p>She&#39;s in it for the long haul, too. Magadishu is her home. &quot;Mogadishu has always been my home in my heart. I was not in Mogadishu for 20-some-odd years, but Mogadishu has always been, and will always be my home.&quot;</p>\n\n<img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-02-18%2Fone-woman-challenges-perceptions-somalia-one-instagram-post-time&feed=pmp\" /><br><p>From PRI's The World Â©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0218201503.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0218201503mp3"}]}
