The Dodgers pitcher, a left-hander, had ruptured his medial collateral ligament â€” an injury that at the time meant the end for any pitcher's major league career.</p><p>Jobe told him, John says, that the chances of his ever pitching again were \"less than 5 percent.\" But a year later, John was throwing again in an instructional league game. He would go on to pitch for 14 more seasons in the big leagues, compiling a <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=116550#gameType='R'&sectionType=career&statType=2&season=2014&level='ALL'\" target=\"_blank\">career record of 288 wins to 231 losses</a>. After the Dodgers, he pitched for the then-California Angels and the New York Yankees.</p><p>While he was lucky to have Jobe as his surgeon, John also believes the surgeon was lucky to have a stubborn athlete as a patient. John was more than willing to have the surgery and to do the rehabilitation work that followed.</p><p>As for his friend, anyone who met Jobe, says John, \"would think he was just some mild-mannered person from Greensboro, N.C.\"</p><p>Jobe would say, his most famous patient remembers, \" 'I'm not a great surgeon, but I have the best patients in the world.' \"</p><p>Much more from John's conversation about Jobe is due on Friday's edition of <em>All Things Considered</em>. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/stations/\">Click here</a> to find an NPR station that broadcasts or streams the show.</p><p>For much more about \"Tommy John surgery,\" a good place to start is this package of <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1675444-tommy-john-surgery-the-realities-and-myths-of-sports-most-famous-operation\" target=\"_blank\">stories from the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>' Bleacher Report</a>.
