Much of their recent social media activity had also revolved around ISIS and ISIS supporters.</p>\n<p>Family members made public pleas for the girls to reconsider and return. Amira's father, Abase Hussen, told the BBC that his message for his daughter was simple: \"We miss you. We cannot stop crying. Please think twice. Don't go to Syria.\"</p>\n<p>Their disappearance has reopened a debate over the appeal of ISIS to some young British Muslims, in spite of concerted efforts to combat the group's message. According to Aminul Hoque, author of \"British-Islamic Identity: Third Generation Bangladeshis from East London,\" attempts to counteract ISIS propaganda are made more difficult by a growing generation gap in some British Muslim communities.</p>\n<p>Two of the missing girls were from East London's Bangladeshi community, for whom questions of identity have grown more complex, according to Hoque. \"It's the notion of feeling like a tourist\" he says. \"[Young British-Bangladeshis] see themselves are British, as Londoners, as Muslims — yet they are constantly reminded that they are not British. So it is a pingpong generation, a generation in exile.\"</p>\n<p>Hoque says that the Bangladeshi community as a whole has been in shock since news emerged that the girls appeared to have been recruited by extremists. \"These young women — they look like my nieces, they look like my students,\" he says, \"I cannot believe — and neither can the community — that this happened. We are all in shock, and we have no straight-forward answers.\"</p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-02-23%2Fwe-cannot-stop-cryingdont-go-syria-search-londons-missing-schoolgirls&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0223201507.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0223201507mp3"}]}
