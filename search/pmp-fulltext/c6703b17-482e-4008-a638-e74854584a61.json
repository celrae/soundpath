Asa Hutchinson is calling for changes to a religious objection measure facing a backlash from businesses and gay rights groups, saying it wasn&#8217;t intended to allow discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p><p>The Republican governor on Wednesday said he wants changes to a bill lawmakers sent him prohibiting state and local government from infringing upon someone&#8217;s religious beliefs without a compelling interest. Hutchinson said he wants the Legislature to either recall the bill or pass a follow-up measure to make the proposal more closely mirror a 1993 federal religious freedom law.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://ualrpublicradio.org/people/michael-hibblen\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Hibblen</a></strong>, news director at KUAR in Little Rock, Arkansas.
