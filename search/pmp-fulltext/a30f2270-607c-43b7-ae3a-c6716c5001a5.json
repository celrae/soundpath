But now the company is searching for a new identity — and business stream. As consumers abandon PCs, the CEO is looking toward an untested area.","itags":["npr_api","375992376"],"guid":"a30f2270-607c-43b7-ae3a-c6716c5001a5","contentencoded":"<p>The International Consumer Electronics Show came to a close Friday in Las Vegas — and with it: the end of a performance. The show is meant to be a happy time: party hard. Put your best face forward — even if you're not sure about the future of your company. The CEO of Intel, the chipmaker, is in just that awkward position.</p><p><strong>The Performer</strong></p><p>On stage at the Venetian hotel, a pop band and a cellist play a rendition of the song \"Radioactive.\" The combination of modern and classical form, the refrain \"Welcome to the new age, to the new age\" — it was a fitting prelude to the real show.</p><p>The tens of thousands of people at the week-long show didn't come for the musicians. They came to this gadget-fest for the engineers, for people like Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, who was the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6a3tKOwN7A\">opening night headliner</a>.</p><p>As Krzanich stepped on stage, the audience expected to be dazzled. And he dazzled them with <a href=\"http://iq.intel.com/latest-camera-trends-make-it-wearable-with-nixie/\">Nixie</a>, which he called \"the first wearable camera that can fly.\"</p><p>The must-have drone has legs that fold around your wrist like a watchband. And when you want that selfie from the sky, unclasp it and it can hover around you to shoot.</p><p>\"Now those of you in the audience,\" Krzanich says, \"Get your cameras ready — we're about to witness history.\"</p><p>We watch Nixie take the first flying photo on the stage of this electronics show – and it's made possible by an Intel chip.</p><p>For an hour, Krzanich uses whiz-bang technology to make a case: Just like Google is the software platform for developers around the world, Intel — the chipmaker — is the hardware platform. From drones to refrigerators to bracelets — if it computes, if it's smart, if it needs to communicate — it should be done with Intel inside. At least, that's the hope.</p><p><strong>A Comeback — With Wearable Devices?</strong></p><p>\"It's a hard slog,\" says Michael Malone. \"It can look like your divorced uncle going out dancing on a Friday night.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOyHIWNzVSg\">Malone</a>, the author of the book <em>The Intel Trinity, </em>says the company founded in 1968 fell behind the smartphone revolution and poured its money into making big chips for more intelligent PCs and servers. \"That was a fairly reasonable conclusion to draw,\" Malone says. \"However, it was the wrong one.\"</p><p>Intel is now betting on the wearable device movement — like that wearable drone — even though it might flop. And according to <a href=\"http://www.l2inc.com/research/wearables-2014\">research sponsored by Intel</a>, customers are not sold.</p><p>But, Malone says, Intel has to show the world that the company's in the game: \"They're not stodgy old Intel. They're making connections with a lot of interesting folks that are doing interesting things.\"</p><p><strong>This Is Not The PC Era</strong></p><p>Off stage, CEO Krzanich talks about the new kinds of companies he's working with in this wearable era. Take the fashion industry: \"They're used to changing product right up until the last moment, as fashion and what's desirable shifts. And that's something we've had to adapt to.\"</p><p>Brands like Oakley sunglasses and Fossil watches are really different from the old PC makers — and from each other. And, Krzanich admits, he's not into the scene per se.</p><p>\"I can't say I went to any of the parties,\" he says about his time at New York Fashion Week. \"An engineer at fashion week. It's not the exciting thing. It's not like a tech show.\"</p><p>Intel has a real technology challenge: to figure out a button-sized superchip that'll serve the needs of many new, fragmented partners. Krzanich unveiled a prototype called <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/wearables/wearable-soc.html\">Curie</a>, which does not yet have a price.</p><p>Intel's got to get the price right. Back in the PC era, it sold chips for as much as $1,000 — and had nice margins. But when I roam this convention floor and ask device-makers what they'd pay for a quality chip, I get single-digit answers: mostly $1 or $2.</p><p>Mark Watterson with <a href=\"https://www.ifit.com/\">iFit.com</a> says he'd go as high as $6. \"The current chips on the market are limiting\" his smartwatches and smart shoes, he says. But an expensive chip would have to be \"good.\"</p><p>Intel's chips — which are more than good — might be overkill. And so, as CEO Krzanich walks passed poker tables to lead Intel demos, he is making a gamble.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
