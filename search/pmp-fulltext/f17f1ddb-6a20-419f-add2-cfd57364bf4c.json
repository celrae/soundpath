They transformed that big, open room into an intimate affair. So having them perform at the Tiny Desk, an already intimate space, was a thrill. It was also the first appearance of a flugabone here. Kristoffer Lo plays that mournful horn and Ingrid Helene Håvik compliments the yearning with words that are mysterious, somewhat dark and contain surprising twists.</p><p>The song titles on their 2014 album <em>Silent Treatment</em> seem more like chapter headings in a crime novel<em>. </em>\"Leaving No Traces,\" \"I, The Hand Grenade,\" \"The Man on the Ferry,\" \"Science & Blood Tests\" — you get the picture. But this band has a powerful pop side filled with drama made of drums, synths, guitar and the aforementioned flugabone and voice. So glad I get to turn you on to a new favorite of mine.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"The Man on the Ferry\"</li><li>\"Since Last Wednesday\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Olivia Merrion; Production Assistant: Becky Lettenberger; photo by Olivia Merrion/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
