But on the other, there’s caution.</p>\n<p>“Fear and trepidation about foreclosure is higher than it’s been in the past,” says Beyond Housing CEO Chris Krehmeyer, while driving through some affordable neighborhoods where the organization builds and rents homes. “We think that’s a good thing. We want people to go into this eyes wide open.”</p>\n<p>He stops on short on a dead-end street, in front of a new brick home with beige siding that’s been on the market for over a year. “From a sheer what-you-can-buy-for-what-you-can-afford [perspective], the house itself is a great value,” he says. “However, when you think about the neighborhood and the community, is this the place that you think is the best investment possible for you?”&nbsp; The house next to it is vacant, boarded up with rotting plywood. A few houses down, there’s what Krehmeyer figures is a fresh eviction; a former tenant’s belongings are piled on the front lawn.</p>\n<p>Krehmeyer wants people to buy here, because homeowners who are literally invested in a neighborhood can help stabilize it. But he also knows that some of the best deals right now can be risky investments. It’s difficult for a potential homebuyer to know whether that nice brick home will retain its value. And will that value increase over time? It’s hard to predict what will happen to a neighborhood in five or ten years.</p>\n<p>Plus, money that’s tied up in a house can’t be invested in other places.</p>\n<p>“Historically, the stock market has outperformed the housing market in terms of an investment,” says Ray Boshara, a senior advisor with the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis. “Many people even think it’s wrong to think of home-ownership as an investment given the risk.”</p>\n<p>Boshara says low-income buyers need to build up savings and other investments; they shouldn’t let all their money get tied up in a house. But homeownership does have its advantages.</p>\n<p>“There are tax subsidies to support homeownership for a big part of the population,” he says. “And there’s other evidence that when people own homes, there’s other outcomes associated with that, like saving and investing.
