But they'd be wrong.</p><p>\"I was really very private, I guess,\" the singer says. \"I joined choir for one semester when I was a junior and I was afraid to sing â€” I wouldn't sing in that class. So I just sang in private, and then I felt pretty comfortable around Matt, becoming pretty close with him.\"</p><p>\"Matt\" is bandmate Matt Holmen, one of Martin's earliest supporters.</p><p>\"I just heard a quality of her voice that I didn't hear in anyone else's voice,\" Holmen says. \"Music for me is like a math problem, and for Monica it was clearly an intuition.\"</p><p>That voice and intuition have become the driving force of Phox, a six-piece pop ensemble from Wisconsin that has just released its self-titled debut. Martin and Holmen recently spoke with NPR's Melissa Block about the new album and how the members have grown together as friends and creative colleagues.
