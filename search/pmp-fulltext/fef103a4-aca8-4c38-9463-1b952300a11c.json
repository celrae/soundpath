He was 81.</p><p>McKuen died Thursday morning at a rehabilitation center in Beverly Hills, California, where he had been treated for pneumonia and had been ill for several weeks and was unable to digest food, his half-brother Edward McKuen Habib said.</p><p>Until his sabbatical in 1981, McKuen was an astonishingly successful and prolific force in popular culture, turning out hundreds of songs, poems and records. Sentimental, earnest and unashamed, he conjured a New Age spirit world that captivated those who didn&#8217;t ordinarily like &#8220;poetry&#8221; and those who craved relief from the war, assassinations and riots of the time.</p><p>His best-known songs, some written with the Belgian composer Jacques Brel, include &#8220;Birthday Boy,&#8221; &#8220;A Man Alone,&#8221; &#8220;If You Go Away&#8221; and &#8220;Seasons In the Sun,&#8221; a chart-topper in 1974 for Terry Jacks. He was nominated for Oscars for &#8220;Jean&#8221; from &#8220;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&#8221; and for &#8220;A Boy Named Charlie Brown,&#8221; the title track from the beloved Peanuts movie.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
