The land and the house cost $85,000 -- that’s more than his entire life savings. Americans still mainly go to Mexico and Canada to retire, but Central America is quickly becoming the next big deal.

He was happy for a while. But then Dungan discovered someone had been stealing electricity from his meter, and the power company wouldn’t help.

As the troubles added up, Costa Rica lost its charm, and Dungan had a revelation: “We shouldn’t be here.”</p>\n<p>But they couldn’t go home to Texas just yet, because no one would buy their house. A year later --&nbsp;fed up, and $100,000 in the hole --&nbsp;they simply walked away.</p>\n<p>Now Dungan offers this advice: “Don’t buy property. Don’t build a house. Don’t buy a house. The recommendation is rent.” For Americans visiting Costa Rica, however, it’s hard to resist all the advertisements in English that sell the dream of cheap land.</p>\n<p>That includes Americans like Bill Peace, who visited his new house for the first time in May. The first phase of Los Tucanes is a development of a dozen or so colorful casitas cast against the deep green of the surrounding jungle. Peace’s casita is simple as can be. It’s made of concrete.
