Cows have died according to a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Tzg4Xh\" target=\"_blank\">Cornell study</a> tallying reports of human and animal ailments near drill sites.

Shale gas drilling has several steps. One is fracking, sending water, sand and chemicals down the well. Has frac fluid ever entered groundwater?

There, residents near a drilling site <a href=\"http://bit.ly/S7lElg\" target=\"_blank\">suspected&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>water contamination near a site where the company fracked very close to a shallow water source.
