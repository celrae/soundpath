Don&#8217;t get on the phone and lose your cool. It&#8217;s much better to fire off a letter or email.<ul><li>&#8220;I’m old fashioned,&#8221; says Jasper who believes in sending an old fashioned letter. &#8220;Email is transient and easy to pass on.&#8221;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Find the person who cares:</strong> There are some companies that don’t care &#8212; the trick is to get through to someone in the organization who does care.<ul><li>How do you get to that person? Get through to someone at the top, a CEO will care more than a lower down employee.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Be funny:</strong> If you can have a one-to-one dialog with a real human being and inject humor you can have remarkable results.<ul><li>Try writing a poem or just make your letter stand out. &#8220;I once sent a letter in a pink envelope&#8230; sealed with a loving kiss,&#8221; says Jasper. That way, he knew the secretary wouldn&#8217;t open it, and it made it all the way to the leader&#8217;s desk.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Think like an American.</strong><ul><li>&#8220;American’s are much better complainers,&#8221; says Jasper. &#8220;There’s a problem with the British psyche &#8230; we don’t express ourselves.&#8221;</li></ul></li></ol><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://complainer.co.uk/about-me/\">Jasper Griegson</a></strong>, lawyer, expert complainer and former complaint columnist for the British newspaper The Daily Express.
