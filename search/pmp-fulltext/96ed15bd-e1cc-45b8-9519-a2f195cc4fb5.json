She soon answered a newspaper ad to take in a pet dove, became a volunteer at local bird shelter and then a certified aviculturist. Eventually, she opened her home to a variety of endangered and exotic species, some of which had been illegally captured in the wild. By trial and error -- and with help from a few willing experts -- she went from fostering birds in need of a home to breeding them in captivity. Now she runs one of the nationâ€™s largest bird sanctuaries. Diane talks with Michele Raffin about her journey from naive bird rescuer to accomplished breeder and conservationist.</p>","itags":["npr_api","354362096"],"contentencoded":"<p><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 MPX.
