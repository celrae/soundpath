He couldn&#8217;t sell it, and nearly gave up until the age of video dawned. Once again, he tried to market the movie, but again, to no avail.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Barry, the film had been pirated in the U.K., where it it became a kind of cult classic, with a Rocky Horror Picture Show-type following. It wasn&#8217;t until 2001 that filmmaker Barry realized what had happened, when he found a discussion about &#8220;Death Bed&#8221; in an online film forum.</p><p>Barry used the momentum to have the movie finally released directly to video, and then to DVD. And now, it&#8217;s going to hit the stage.</p><p>Playwright <strong>Gwenyfar Rohler</strong> has adapted to the movie into a stage show, aptly titled: &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.deathbedtheplay.com/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">Death Bed: The Play That Bites</a>.&#8221; It opens tomorrow at <a href=\"http://www.bigdawgproductions.org/2014-season.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Dawg&#8217;s Halloween Horror Theatre Festival</a> in Wilmington, North Carolina.
