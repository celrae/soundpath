On this week's show, we share our favorite music from debut albums released in the first half of this year. It's only June, but we picked the music we're already eyeing for our year-end lists in December.</p><p>Bob Boilen and Katie Presley are joined on this episode by several members of the NPR Music team, who brought an astounding collection of songs that span genre, language and geography. We have gorgeous Afro-Cuban music from Paris, warm house beats from Amsterdam, a raucous gender liberation anthem from Olympia, heart-tugging punk from Philadelphia and a self-reflective turn from a Long Beach rapper, among others.</p><p>These picks are a very small sampling of what we've loved so far in 2015.
