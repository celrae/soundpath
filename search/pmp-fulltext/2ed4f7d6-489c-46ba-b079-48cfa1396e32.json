But even without beverages, we still had a great time with members of the Peruvian band Novalima serving as <em>Alt.Latino</em> guest DJs.</p><p>Along the way, we took a deep dive into the magic of Afro-Peruvian drumming, discussing how Novalima weaves live percussion into an electronic-based sound with equal parts reverence and fun. The band's members also brought a pile of the music that influenced them, and travel in time back to their first album to mark their growth. It's musicians talking about music, but it's also a good time, with music that grooves non-stop.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
