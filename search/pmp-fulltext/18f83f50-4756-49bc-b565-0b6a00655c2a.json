But that changed three years ago, when civil war broke out in Syria. Al-Qaeda-linked militants fighting the Syrian regime have battled for the border region, and just won control over it. That is making Israelis quite nervous.","contentencoded":"<p>For the last three years, Israelis have mostly enjoyed a safe distance from the fighting in neighboring Syria. Now, that&#39;s no longer true.</p><p>Last week, rebels took a border crossing between Syria and Israeli-held land, capturing a group of UN peacekeepers stationed along the tense frontier. Among the rebels were fighters from Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda&#39;s branch in Syria.</p><p>The takeover means al-Qaeda is now just feet away from Israeli military positions &mdash; and farmlands.</p><p>In the Israeli village of Merom Golan, Gabi Kuniel, the village&#39;s head of agriculture, climbs to the roof of an abandoned building.&nbsp;There &ldquo;could be a little bit danger, even though today is a quiet day,&quot; he warns. &quot;So let&rsquo;s stand behind this wall.&quot;</p><p>The building offers a bird&rsquo;s eye view of Kuniel&#39;s vineyards and apple orchards, set in a beautiful hilly area of the Golan Heights.&nbsp;The&nbsp;climate&nbsp;is perfect for growing fruit. The location? Not so much.</p><p>[[{\"fid\":\"73487\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"height\":1568,\"width\":2352,\"alt\":\"Gabi Kuniel in his orchard of Red Delicious apples, a few hundred feet away from the border fence.\",\"title\":\"Gabi Kuniel in his orchard of Red Delicious apples, a few hundred feet away from the border fence.\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]</p><p>His fruit trees grow right next to the border fence that separates Syria from territory Israel captured in 1967. Israel later annexed the land, a move that was never recognized internationally.</p><p>Israel and Syria are technically still at war, though the frontier between the two was quiet for decades. Then, three years ago, the Syrian civil war broke out.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on in these last three years &mdash; you hear it?&rdquo; Kuniel asks, as heavy machine gunfire erupts beyond the border fence. It&#39;s just a few hundred feet away. &quot;What&rsquo;s going on ... is that you don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s the group who control[s] our fence.&quot;&nbsp;More gunfire punctuates his point.</p><p>Rebels in Syria have been fighting to control this border since the civil war began. Last week, they finally won. A group of opposition fighters overran Syrian troops at the border, capturing the UN peacekeepers.&nbsp;&ldquo;There was a big, big, big, big fight,&rdquo; Kuniel says.</p><p>Israel does not want to open up a new front to the Syrian war, so Israel&#39;s army has mostly held back, only responding to occasional mortar fire when it lands in Israeli-held territory.</p><p>Last week, when the fighting on the other side of the border became fierce,&nbsp;the Israeli army ordered Kuniel&rsquo;s 200 workers out of the orchards and vineyards.</p><p>The Israeli army wasn&rsquo;t participating in the fight, but mortars fired from Syria landed in Kuniel&rsquo;s fields, setting them on fire. Whole patches of his land turned black, and the heat from the nearby fire scorched the grapevine, leaving it dry and crisp to the touch.</p><p>&ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s all burned. Burned leaves,&rdquo; Kuniel says, crumbling the dry grape leaves with his fingers.&nbsp;The smoke from the fire gave the grapes a musky taste. They can&rsquo;t be used for premium wine anymore, which will cost Kuniel $200,000.</p><p>[[{&quot;fid&quot;:&quot;73492&quot;,&quot;view_mode&quot;:&quot;default&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;media&quot;,&quot;link_text&quot;:null,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;height&quot;:865,&quot;width&quot;:1205,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;UN installation on the border fence dividing Syrian and Israeli-held land.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;UN installation on the border fence dividing Syrian and Israeli-held land.&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;media-element file-default&quot;}}]]</p><p>But that&rsquo;s not what worries him. What worries him is the al-Qaeda fighters driving in trucks just feet away from his fruit trees.&nbsp;Kuniel says the extremist fighters actually make him miss Israel&rsquo;s longtime foe, Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose forces used to control the Syrian side of the border.</p><p>&ldquo;We saw what&rsquo;s going on in the last six, seven, eight months in Iraq [and] in Syria,&quot;&nbsp;Kuniel says, as gunfire resumes in the distance. &quot;So&nbsp;we prefer Assad and not al-Qaeda here.&rdquo;</p><p>The capture of the border crossing here by the militants is significant. It was the Syrian government&rsquo;s last major stronghold in the strategic Golan Heights.&nbsp;The rebels now control the entire length of the border.</p><p>Israeli defense officials say they believe the rebels do not pose an immediate threat to Israelis, as they have their sights set on battles within Syria.&nbsp;But Israeli analysts say al-Qaeda fighters do see Israel as a legitimate target &mdash; and now they&rsquo;re at Israel&rsquo;s front door.</p>","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/090520143.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/090520143mp3"}]}
