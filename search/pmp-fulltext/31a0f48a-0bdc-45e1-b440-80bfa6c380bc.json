Sen.&#160;Becky</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> Duncan Massey (R-Knoxville) says she's heard from dozens of potential Insure Tennessee beneficiaries, who have told her the risk of losing insurance later is better than going without it now.</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">\"If they had the opportunity to take for two years or not at all, they were good with just the two years.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">The chance to get Insure Tennessee moving again finally came last week, when the Senate Health Committee took up <a href=\"http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=SJR0093\">Senate Joint Resolution 93</a>. The proposal is essentially the same that lawmakers rejected in the special session, but this panel is loaded with</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">&#160;lawmakers who have been receptive to the idea from the start.</span></p><p>Massey joined the committee's lone Democrat, Yarbro, and four Republicans to approve the measure.&#160;</p><p>But now Insure Tennessee faces more formidable hurdles. Two more hearings are likely, before the Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. Both include more skeptics of the proposal.</p><p>Several hearings also are needed in the state House of Representatives. But&#160;<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">House Minority Leader Craig </span>Fitzhugh&#160;(D-Ripley)<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> says supporters shouldn't get daunted.</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">\"We need to take it a step at a time. I think the possibilities of getting it out of that first subcommittee are pretty significant. And then you move on.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Fitzhugh</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> believes each victory for Insure Tennessee can build momentum for the proposal. But as backers saw in February, all it takes is one defeat to stop it.</span>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 WPLN-FM.
