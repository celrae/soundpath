They spin the ferocious punk energy of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/239235597/perfect-pussy\">Perfect Pussy</a>, the magnetic vocals of Broken Twin, absurdly catchy electro-pop from <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/298363663/sylvan-esso\">Sylvan Esso</a> and much more.</p><p>Bob opens the show with a cut from his favorite new band of 2014, the San Francisco-based seven-piece group known as The Family Crest. The band makes music on an epic scale, with stunning vocals and a multitude of instruments. Stephen then beats Robin to the punch to claim Perfect Pussy as his favorite new band of the year, with the song \"Driver,\" two minutes of howling vocals and surging guitars from the Syracuse band's debut album <em>Say Yes to Love</em>.</p><p>Later in the show Robin returns the favor by snagging Sturgill Simpson as his biggest surprise of the year. \"Turtles All the Way Down\" finds the country singer examining cosmic questions with his heart-wrenching voice and classic country arrangements. Also on the show: A fuzzy rock number from the often-hushed singer Angel Olsen; The German band The Notwist has Stephen's favorite song of the year in \"Kong;\" The band Nothing rumbles and shakes with glorious noise-rock; Damien Jurado's flamingo-tinged \"Silver Timothy\" explodes into a synth-fueled jam and much, much more.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
