Perrotta isn&#8217;t new to having his work adapted to the screen. Previously, Perrotta&#8217;s novels &#8220;Election&#8221; and &#8220;Little Children&#8221; were adapted into Academy Award nominated films.</p><p>But this time, Perrotta is behind the wheel of the adaptation: he is the show&#8217;s co-creator and executive producer, and he co-wrote the pilot as well.</p><p><a href=\"https://hereandnow.wbur.org/\"><em>Here & Now&#8217;</em></a>s Robin Young talks to Perrotta about the process of bringing his book to television.</p><ul><li><strong>WBUR&#8217;s The Artery: </strong><a href=\"http://artery.wbur.org/2014/06/26/leftovers-hbo\" target=\"_blank\">HBO Makes A Tasty Meal Out Of Tom Perrotta’s ‘The Leftovers’</a></li></ul><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shn1mPejr_4\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Interview Highlights</h4><p><strong>On adapting &#8220;The Leftovers&#8221; for TV</strong></p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had books turned into films before, and in that case what you&#8217;re doing is trying to compress the story so that it fits in a 2-hour format. Here, we have ten 1-hour episodes for the season so the book has grown beyond its boundaries. We&#8217;ve created new characters, we&#8217;ve invented new stories to tell. It&#8217;s really been a process of transformation, creating something new.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On what&#8217;s changed in the adaptation</strong></p><p>&#8220;I think one of the things that really happened in this transformative process is that the quietness of the book was amped up &#8230; I think readers will find that &#8216;The Leftovers&#8217; has been given a shot of adrenaline.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the book&#8217;s deeper meaning</strong></p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something crazy about this idea of people just disappearing. But, there&#8217;s also something very true about it.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I know people who&#8217;ve died suddenly. I think the first time it happens to you, the world feels different forever. So I wanted to use it as a metaphor, but I also wanted to sort of undermine apocalyptic conventions and really create an internal apocalypse. The world looks fine, but the people are deeply shaken.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;My father died in a car accident. It was ten years ago, but still, he was there one day and he was not there the next. It took me a very, very long time &#8212; I don&#8217;t think I still have fully absorbed that. You just fear for the people you love in a different way once that happens. And it happens pretty much to everybody in some way or another.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.tomperrotta.net/content.php?page=about&n=1&f=2\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tom Perrotta</strong></a>, author of the novel &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Leftovers-Tom-Perrotta/dp/B0085RZGS6/?tag=wburorg-20\" target=\"_blank\">The Leftovers</a>&#8221; and co-creator and executive producer of the T.V. series &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/the-leftovers#/\" target=\"_blank\">The Leftovers.</a>&#8220;</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
