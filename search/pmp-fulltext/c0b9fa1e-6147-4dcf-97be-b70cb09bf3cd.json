Though the humid haze and some midday I-need-a-coffee-stat office funk hung all around him, he soldiered his way through.</p><p>Throughout his new album, <em>Mali Is</em>..., the singer-songwriter and musician showcases his unabashed positivity and the sort of uplifting spirit that can faithfully be found ringing through choirs down South; as a boy, Mali Music was raised in the church in Savannah, Ga. But when compared to his previous albums — <em>The Coming</em> and <em>The 2econd Coming</em> — the new record avoids the direct, at times repentant, language of traditional gospel music. He says he's using his new perspective to serve a higher purpose, to make a difference. That message travels a bit further when it aligns with the sounds and words of the mainstream; these tools are necessary for adjusting to the secular world.</p><p>In this session, you'll see Mali Music hop from in front of a microphone, backed by booming production streaming from his DJ's laptop, to an intimate cuddle with an acoustic guitar, and finish in a relaxed position behind a keyboard for a touching performance of the album's lead single, \"Beautiful.\" With every song — and between the tracks, with motivational messages strung throughout — he demonstrates his readiness and capability to take on the industry, as he charges forward with an electrifying message of hope.</p><h5><strong>Set List</strong></h5><ul><li>\"Fight For You\"</li><li>\"Make It In\"</li><li>\"Beautiful\"</li></ul><h5><strong>Credits</strong></h5><p><em>Producers: Denise DeBelius, Kiana Fitzgerald; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Colin Marshall; photo by Sarah Tilotta/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
