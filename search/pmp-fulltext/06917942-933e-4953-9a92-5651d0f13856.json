The high school graduation rate for young black men is between 50 and 60 percent, a third of all black men in their thirties have a prison record, only 20 percent of black youth who are not in school are employed.</p><p>But those statistics don&#8217;t tell the whole story, according to Harvard University sociology professor <strong>Orlando Patterson</strong>.</p><p>Patterson says that same community has strong traditionally American values &#8212; from a love of country to a sense of personal responsibility, to a belief in God. And, he says, this same community is also responsible for some of the world&#8217;s most vibrant popular cultures, from music to dance to fashion. So how to explain that disparity?</p><p>Is it because of systematic racism or is it something inherent in the culture? Patterson argues it&#8217;s a combination of both cultural and structural factors in the new book, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Cultural-Matrix-Understanding-Black/dp/0674728750\" target=\"_blank\">The Cultural Matrix: Understanding Black Youth</a>,&#8221; that he recently co-authored with Ethan Fosse.</p><p>&#8220;There is no such think as black culture. The black population is remarkable for the heterogeneity of its cultures. And most of those cultures are fine,&#8221; Patterson tells <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org\"><em>Here & Now&#8217;</em></a>s Robin Young. &#8220;80 percent are either middle class or working class. In fact, often they are very conservative in some of their values &#8230; However there is also street culture.&#8221;</p><p>Patterson says that even though the minority of blacks identify with the street culture &#8212; which he says is violent &#8212; policy makers and law enforcement have generalized that to all blacks.</p><p>&#8220;There is no doubt that we have a serious institutional problem with the police, and that has to change,&#8221; Patterson said. &#8220;One way or another, we have to terms with the fact that the inner city is plagued by chronic violence. It&#8217;s partly cultural and it&#8217;s partly social. But cultures can change.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"secthead\"><div class=\"sectheadtxt\">The Cultural Matrix: Understanding Black Youth</div></div><div class=\"scribd_embed\"><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"//www.scribd.com/embeds/259281093/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-4JLT6lo7j8seeFlHH0mI\" data-auto-height=\"true\"data-aspect-ratio=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div></p><p><em>From The Cultural Matrix edited by Orlando Patterson with Ethan Fosse.
