Yawn, right?</p><p>So you might think. But I asked Chris Klimek to help me unpack why so many critics are praising <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> as something altogether different. We discuss the original Mad Max trilogy from our different perspectives and analyze how <em>Fury Road</em> fits in â€” or doesn't. Chris, who wrote a great <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/05/14/406009465/a-visceral-inventive-blockbuster-roars-to-life-in-mad-max-fury-road\">review for NPR</a>, wonders how a sequel to an '80s franchise can seem inventive. We discuss what Charlize Theron brings to the (sand-blasted, diesel-soaked) table, and we touch on the gratifyingly <a href=\"https://storify.com/wire2k/anita-sarkeesian-on-mad-max-fury-road\">rich discussion</a> that's emerged over the movie's possible status as a feminist parable.</p><p>Oh, and make your day better by reading <a href=\"http://the-toast.net/2015/05/19/movie-yelling-with-shrill-and-mallory-welcome-to-your-steampunk-future-sorry-theres-no-water-but-we-did-put-skulls-on-everything/\">The Toast's excellent discussion</a> of the film.</p><p>What Chris and I <em>don't</em> talk about: why Tom Hardy spends so much of the film with a mask covering his soft, pillowy lips. Which, let's be clear, is the filmmaking equivalent of taking Gretzky off the ice to hawk beer in the stands.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
