He paused several times, looking as if he was trying to remain composed.</p><p>He stood and faced the judge while speaking, but spoke of the victims.</p><p>The apology came after Tsarnaev listened impassively for about three hours as a procession of victims and their loved ones lashed out at him for his &#8220;cowardly&#8221; and &#8220;disgusting&#8221; acts.</p><p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t possibly have had a soul to do such a horrible thing,&#8221; said Karen Rand McWatters, who lost a leg in the attack and whose best friend, 29-year-old Krystle Campbell, was killed.</p><p>Campbell&#8217;s mother, Patricia Campbell, was the first person to address the court. She looked across the room at Tsarnaev, seated about 20 feet away, and spoke directly to him.</p><p>&#8220;What you did to my daughter is disgusting,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to say to you. I think the jury did the right thing.&#8221;</p><p>Twenty-four people in all gave so-called victim impact statements at the sentencing in federal court.</p><p>The outcome was a foregone conclusion: U.S. District Judge George O&#8217;Toole Jr. was required under law to impose the jury&#8217;s death sentence for the April 15, 2013, attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260.</p><p>The only real suspense was whether Tsarnaev would say anything when given a chance to speak near the end of the proceedings.</p><p>Until Wednesday, has said almost nothing publicly since his arrest more than two years ago, offering neither remorse nor explanation.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/about/people/jack-lepiarz\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jack Lepiarz</strong></a>, reporter at WBUR in Boston.
