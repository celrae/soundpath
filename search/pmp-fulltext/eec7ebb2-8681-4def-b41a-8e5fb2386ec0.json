He spoke the language. ... I had a lot of respect for him. He was young, but he was very dedicated.&rdquo;</p><p>Di Giovanni says she was in touch with him until he was abducted a year ago. &ldquo;One of the last messages I had from him was that he was very concerned that there had been a list of journalist who had been targeted or were being considered [as targets by militants].&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a very striking email he sent to me, which basically said &lsquo;we&rsquo;re all na√Øve when we think about how we all feel like we&rsquo;re never going to die.&rsquo; Over the last 20 years I&rsquo;ve lost so many colleagues, and so many close friends who felt the same way. [They] just never felt that that bullet, or that mortar, or that sniper [would get them]. Or in this case that he&rsquo;d be kidnapped and that he would die in such a horrific way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We cannot give into ISIS and allow them to instil this fear into us so that we can&rsquo;t go to Syria and report on the suffering of the civilians, which is what Steven was doing. This is what they want. If we let them do this, they&rsquo;ve won. ... These are terrible, dark times. ... We can&rsquo;t abandon Syria. That&rsquo;s something Jim Foley and Steve would not have wanted. They were both deeply, deeply committed to this story.&rdquo;</p>","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/Steven%20Sotloff_CROP.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"/file/steven-sotloffcropjpg"}]}
