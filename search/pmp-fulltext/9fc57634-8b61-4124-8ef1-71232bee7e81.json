Filing early will give you time to budget, or, to save money before the balance is due. And, if you find out you owe a ton, you can always make a payment arrangement with the IRS.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Get your refund, now.</strong> <span>The National Society of Accountants says in recent years early filers have received refunds in 21 days. Taxpayers filing nearer the deadline day waited an average of 31 days. Why wait for your money?</span></li>\n<li><strong>Help the children.</strong> <span>Having your tax return may help in getting financing. Banks and other lenders, especially small business lenders, often require current tax returns to be submitted with loan applications. And if you have children applying for college financial aid, your tax return information may be required for the financial aid form.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Take your financial responsibility to the next level.</strong> <span>Use your tax refund to fund an IRA. The IRA contribution doesn't have to be funded until your tax filing deadline (April 15 for most people).</span></li>\n<li><strong>Prevent mistakes.</strong> <span>Want a a sleep deprived, overworked accountant doing your taxes? Not so much. One extra zero, or a missing deduction could hurt, big time. Get your taxes done early when your tax preparer is feeling energetic and ready to go.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Buy yourself time.</strong> <span>The last minute is no time to discover a wrinkle that complicates your tax situation. Nor is the last minute the time to make a hurried and careless mistake in your return – a mistake that could trigger an audit.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Prepare for the ultimate battle.</strong> <span>Let's say you do get audited. Filing early means you had time to get your paperwork together and think through your decisions. Maybe the IRS has questions about deductions for your home office or chartiable contributions but you are READY. Bring it taxman!&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Beat the criminals to your refund.</strong>&nbsp;Identity theft is a pricey problem when it comes to taxes. If a thief files a false return using your stolen identity (before you file a real one) it could take up to a year to get your money back. Beat the bad guys by filing your return first.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li><strong>Skip the line.</strong> <span>If you're one of the three out of ten taxpayers who still mails in your returns on paper the line at the post office in April is going to be LONG.
