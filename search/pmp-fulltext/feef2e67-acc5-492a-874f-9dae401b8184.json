The depression was there, which kind of forced me into the stand up. I was so deeply depressed I had nowhere to go but down.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Depression was almost the impetus to do the stand up. If I was happy, I don&#8217;t know that I would have gotten on stage in front of strangers and tried to make them laugh.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the contract between the comedian and the audience</strong></p><p>My theory about the audience is that the audience wants to feel relaxed, and they want to feel like the comedian is in control. The contract you have with them is &#8216;I&#8217;m going to take care of you for this next hour.'&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;You know when you feel really uncomfortable when you see a bad comic or when you see a comic dying? That&#8217;s because the contract is broken. You, the audience member, has to take care of them.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.susieessman.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Susie Essman</strong></a>, comedienne and actress.
