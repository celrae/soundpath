Leone's vision of the American West remains singular — and it's impossible to imagine without the iconic music of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/16131391/ennio-morricone\" target=\"_blank\">Ennio Morricone</a>.</p><p>Morricone's music is inseparable from the emotional texture of an astonishingly diverse number of films: <em>The Battle of Algiers</em>, <em>The Mission</em>, <em>The Thing</em>, <em>Cinema Paradiso</em> and so many others. He's a fixture of the cultural landscape now, but as a young composer, Morricone was a radical. Long before the spaghetti westerns, he was working modern American sounds into his experimental ensemble, Il Gruppo di Improvvisazione di Nuova Consonanza — <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1S6WsvfI6w\" target=\"_blank\">Il Gruppo for short</a>.</p><p>Speaking from his house in Rome, the 85-year-old Morricone recently told NPR's Arun Rath that Il Gruppo's approach began as a joke: a collection of friends spoofing on the work of one of their contemporaries, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/91576532/john-cage\" target=\"_blank\">John Cage</a>.
