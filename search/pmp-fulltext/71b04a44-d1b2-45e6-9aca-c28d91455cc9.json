They both say profound things drawing from these two different viewpoints.</p><p>&#8220;I photographed this little kid and he was dressed like Batman, and I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. He said he wanted to be a police officer. I said, What’s going to be the best part of being a police officer? And he said, &#8216;Finding out who made the mistakes.&#8217;”</p><p><strong>On photographing people as part of a United Nations Tour</strong></p><p>“What I realized that with people who don’t have security in their lives, or don’t have means to put food on the table, the mind kind of blocks out access to these other spheres of existence. Whether that be your hopes or your aspirations or even your memories. That was eye-opening to me.”</p><p><strong>On his happiest memory</strong></p><p>“The absolute most honest answer was when I found out the book was the number one New York Times best seller, because it was something that I really wasn’t expecting.&#8221;</p><p>“For this book of photography that I barely got published, that I barely got a book deal for, to suddenly be the number one selling book in the country, it was just immediately a flood of release of all the frustration and hard work and loneliness that came out of chasing something crazy like this. I started crying in a parking lot and did that for a good hour. That was the happiest moment of my life.”</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.humansofnewyork.com/about\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Brandon Stanton</strong></a>, photographer behind &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.humansofnewyork.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Humans of New York</a>.&#8221; He tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/humansofny\" target=\"_blank\">@humansofny</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
