He's a bassist who's worked with everyone from <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15678496/mccoy-tyner\">McCoy Tyner</a> to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/14862352/diana-krall\">Diana Krall</a> to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15158238/paul-mccartney\">Paul McCartney</a>. His latest gig is as the host of NPR's <em><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/347139849/jazz-night-in-america\">Jazz Night In America</a></em>, \"a portrait of jazz music today, as seen through many of its exceptional live performances and performers,\" as <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/ablogsupreme/2014/10/08/353041054/what-is-jazz-night-in-america\">we wrote</a> in October.</p><p>McBride recently sat down with NPR's Audie Cornish to discuss what he's excited about in jazz this year. Two new albums came to mind, including Fresh Cut Orchestra's <em>From The Vine</em> (\"I really like the way that they work with layers\") and pianist Aaron Goldberg's <em>The Now</em> (\"I think Aaron is absolutely brilliant\"). McBride says he's particularly drawn to Goldberg's commitment to the swing.</p><p>\"Everything is cyclical,\" McBride says. \"In the jazz world right now, it's not too popular to play swing rhythms. But if you're talking about something with a legacy as deep and as vast as jazz, one thing that's always been constant in that tradition is the swing rhythm.\"</p><p>McBride says he's also looking forward to celebrating two major birthdays in jazz. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15294441/herbie-hancock\">Herbie Hancock</a> turns 75, and McBride shares a cut from <em>The Warner Bros. Years (1969-1972)</em>, a collection that highlights the Mwandishi band: \"It was funky, it was swingin', it was avant-garde, it was land, it was water, it was everything.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15670893/roy-haynes\">Roy Haynes</a>, an icon to jazz drummers, turns 90 this year.</p><p>\"Without a doubt, Roy Haynes is a science project,\" McBride says. \"He is still so spry at age 90 and still sounding great.\"</p><p>You can hear the conversation by clicking on the audio link.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
