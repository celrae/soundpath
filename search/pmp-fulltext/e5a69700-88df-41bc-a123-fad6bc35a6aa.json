An automatic camera takes a photo of a violator's license plate, then police find the registered owner and send out a ticket. South Dakota legislators have passed a law that will not allow their state's Department of Transportation to release vehicle information for this purpose. South Dakota Public Broadcasting's Gary Ellenbolt reports that the bill was co-sponsored by a state senator who has reportedly received several of these tickets. The senator claims that with photo enforcement, there's no right for a defendant to face the accuser, as guaranteed by the Constitution.","itags":["npr_api","316728734"],"guid":"e5a69700-88df-41bc-a123-fad6bc35a6aa","contentencoded":"<p><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
