You better believe it","contentencoded":"<div class=\"barn-cleaned\"><p>Silicon Valley, of course, is known for its casual dress, which means t-shirts, jeans and sneakers. But don't be fooled, techies care a lot more about fashion than they let on. Or put another way, there’s a lot of code in the Silicon Valley dress code.</p>\n<p>In fact, engineer Alexey Komissarouk boasted he could tell if people were in tech and what they did by just looking at their dress. I met him a few months ago at the <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/can-zuckerbergs-fwdus-can-immigration-reform-passed\" target=\"_blank\">FWD.us hackathon</a> and I asked him to show me his super power. He agreed and we met in downtown Palo Alto.</p>\n<p>Before we got started, <a href=\"http://alexeymk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Komissarouk</a> explained that the Silicon Valley is full of tribes: there are the engineers, designers, product managers, salespeople, entrepreneurs and VCs. And each tribe has its uniform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The engineers? T-shirts, jeans and hoodies, of course.</p>\n<p>“Hoodie signals young talent,” said Dan Woods, a techie we stopped on the street. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Woods walked by us and Komissarouk nudged me and said, “That guy, he’s a VC.”</p>\n<p>The tip off? A zippered v-neck sweater.</p>\n<p>“That’s like classic VC and then you got the button down underneath it, that’s like the classic uniform,” Komissarouk said.</p>\n<p>We stopped Woods and asked him. Turns out, he did work in venture capital, which is about when he got the sweater.</p>\n<p>Turns out the uniform is a long time tradition in tech, says Erik Schnakenberg, a co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.buckmason.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buck Mason</a>, a start-up that sells men's clothing online.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"I wear a pair of jeans and a black t-shirt almost everyday,\" Schnakenberg said. \"It's one less thing to think about.\"</p>\n<p>In the fast-moving world of tec, the idea is to show that your'e not wasting precious time on something as vain as fashion. Schnakenberg &nbsp;says the uniform hasn't changed much but tech is attracting a lot more of the cool kids and they care about fashion.</p>\n<p>After my lesson with Komissarouk, I went to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park,_San_Francisco\" target=\"_blank\">South Park</a> in San Francisco, a techie hub, and put myself to the test. I tried to guess what people did from the way they were dressed.

The kicks made me think that maybe he could be a designer? I was wrong on both fronts, Dan is in sales at a start-up. But turns out, he meant to confuse me.

He looks like he's wearing a black sweat shirt but it's definately not sports gear, it's designer. His kicks are stylish and his jeans crisp, dark denim. It's the engineer's outfit but with a little more flair and so I pegged him as a designer. Turns out I was right, or at least sort of.
