But for some applicants, it's a reason not to apply.</p><p>Over the weekend, New York University announced a change in how it handles the answer to that question. Students will still have to check that box, but admissions officers won't see it right away.</p><p>Applicants to the school will initially be reviewed without any knowledge of criminal records, explains MJ Knoll-Finn, the vice president for enrollment management at NYU.</p><p>Admissions officers are trained to be unbiased, Knoll-Finn says, but not knowing the criminal history in that first round of selection will be an added help. After that, a special committee will determine whether there's anything of concern. The process aims to allow NYU a chance to preserve safety on campus, while not ruling out applicants for youthful mistakes.</p><p>\"We believe in second chances,\" says Knoll-Finn.</p><p>A majority of colleges do ask about criminal histories — some 20 percent don't, according to the <a href=\"http://www.communityalternatives.org/\">Center for Community Alternatives</a>, an organization that advocates for alternatives to incarceration.</p><p>Asking about criminal backgrounds has little to do with actual safety concerns, says Marsha Weissman, the group's executive director.</p><p>\"People of color are much more likely to be arrested, convicted,\" she says. \"What this is really doing is undermining campus diversity goals.\"</p><p>Weissman co-authored a report, released earlier this year, that surveyed screening policies in the State University of New York system — which is separate from NYU. The report found nearly two-thirds who had a felony conviction were discouraged by that one question. \"When they see the question, they say — 'I'm not gonna get in.' \"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
