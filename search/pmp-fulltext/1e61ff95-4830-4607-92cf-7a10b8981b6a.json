In South Dakota, however, it's an egregious $755 per head. Lotto games bring in the most money per person in the mid-Atlantic and northeast: number-one Rhode Island (nearly $800 per capita!), Massachusetts, and Delaware are among the top five states, while New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania join them in the top 13 (so does Washington, D.C.).</p></blockquote><p>Thompson joins <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson to discuss the states where lottery spending is highest, and the morality of states earning money this way.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/author/derek-thompson/\">Derek Thompson</a></strong>, senior editor at The Atlantic.
