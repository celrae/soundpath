There are the effects on children, including my own. There are the effects on teachers and schools. And then, you know, more broadly there’s the effects on society and what this is doing to public schools as one of our democratic institutions.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On how to respond in states where testing is required to advance</strong></p><p>&#8220;That’s a tricky question, I’ll be honest. I think it’s going to require a lot of pushback in order to get that repealed. So if one or two parents do that, they may face the consequences of ‘gosh, is my child going to stay back?’ I would recommend that they look closely at the law and not just rely on what they’re being told. Most likely, that law is also going to say that there are other evaluative instruments that they use in determining a child moving from grade three to grade four, in addition to that test. And one of the reason we’re advocating for what we call sort of a refusal or a boycott of the testing, is in a large part because we’re using data from a test that study after study after study have shown are not necessarily reliable or valid in assessing what they claim to assess.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On how to measure U.S. students against other countries without tests</strong></p><p>&#8220;People like to fall back on that narrative, but it ignores a lot of the pertinent information, first of which is that the number one determining factor of how well you will do on your standardized test is your zip code. We know that poverty is the biggest determining factor in how children perform on standardized tests. Now, if we’re under-performing, say, behind Finland that’s because we have a 50 percent poverty rate and they only have a 4 percent poverty rate. You know, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily access all of the other measures that enable us to be competitive as a nation. <div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;The number one determining factor of how well you will do on your standardized test is your zip code.&#8221;</p><p></div></p><p>&#8220;For example, we didn&#8217;t really rely on standardized testing for much of anything prior to No Child Left Behind. So, how on earth is it that we became this global empire, the top dog, before we ever had standardized testing drive our curriculum? It’s not to say that we don’t have problems in our schools. We clearly have problems of equity and poverty. We have the highest segregation rates since Brown v. Board, but none of these problems will ever be resolved by test-driven policies.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On whether refusing to take a standardized test hurts schools or teachers</strong></p><p>&#8220;I don’t know of any school that has been closed as a result of testing refusals. I know of no teacher that has been fired because the students refused the test. I know a lot of schools that have been closed because of failing test scores. I know a lot of teachers who have lost their jobs because of failing test scores. So the question shouldn&#8217;t be, why would you refuse the test? The questions should be, why wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Morna McDermott</strong>, founding organizer of the national &#8220;<a href=\"http://unitedoptout.com/\" target=\"_blank\">United Opt-Out</a>&#8221; movement.
