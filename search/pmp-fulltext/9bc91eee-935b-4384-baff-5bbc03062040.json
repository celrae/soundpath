It made a lot of money, and that got us thinking: How does this fit into the larger arc of Denzel Washington? For that discussion, we brought in our pal Tanya Ballard Brown, who has spoken on the show before about her affection for this particular actor and some of his films. So in this episode, we chat about his intriguing mix of stoicism and high-powered charisma, as well as about the wicked grin that is unfortunately largely absent from this latest effort.</p><p>And then we move along to <em>Gilligan's Island</em>, which is <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2014/09/26/351794725/gilligans-island-at-50-a-goofy-show-from-a-time-of-tv-innocence\" target=\"_blank\">hitting the 50th anniversary</a> of its arrival. It's not that we necessarily have <em>all </em>that much to say about the glory of Gilligan and friends, but we do take a moment to reflect on the absurdist era of television comedy (in which Martians, genies, and talking cars and horses ran free) and whether it resembles anything we have today. Naturally, this also means that we explore some of our favorite episodes, with audio that's well worth hearing.</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about a surge in great music to edit by (important to him!), including the <em>Gone Girl </em>soundtrack (still available <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/09/25/350948108/first-listen-trent-reznor-atticus-ross-gone-girl-motion-picture-soundtrack\" target=\"_blank\">at NPR Music</a> as of this writing!), some other music included in a recent <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2014/09/30/352733565/new-mix-thom-yorke-robert-plant-aphex-twin-trent-reznor-more\" target=\"_blank\">episode of All Songs Considered</a>, and a record from <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/09/28/350636690/first-listen-a-winged-victory-for-the-sullen-atomos\" target=\"_blank\">an artist</a> that really does seem to be named after the depths of Stephen's soul. Glen is happy about <a href=\"http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/70300800?locale=en-US\" target=\"_blank\">a show</a> with a cast he can't believe he didn't think of himself. Tanya is happy about several books she's taking on vacation when she finally has time to read, including <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8171378-the-warmth-of-other-suns?from_search=true\" target=\"_blank\">one that's for book club</a>.
