When a Florida businessman put them together to make a band, there was chemistry, tight harmonies, creative facial hair — and a formula for success.</p><p>Twenty years later, the teenybopper pop boom in which the Backstreet Boys found globe-smashing success has faded, transformed and risen afresh, with all-new groups of cute, pubescent performers taking up the torch. But in all that time, the Backstreet Boys never quite went away — or let up.</p><p>\"Kevin is 43 years old, and he's still up there cuttin' a jig.
