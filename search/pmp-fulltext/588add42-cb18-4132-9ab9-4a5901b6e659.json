Then, we remember some of the toys of our youth and wonder how play has changed.","itags":["npr_api","328414113"],"guid":"588add42-cb18-4132-9ab9-4a5901b6e659","contentencoded":"<p>Stephen Thompson and I are joined this week by our blog siblings Gene Demby and Kat Chow of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/\" target=\"_blank\">NPR's Code Switch</a>, which always puts us in an upbeat and playful mood. Fittingly, we take a couple of listener questions this week about youth and play.</p><p>First, is it possible to be too old for youth culture? We approach this from a couple of angles: can you be too old for the content itself? Can you be too old for the experience of swooning over cultural experiences the way you did when you were younger? And what is it, exactly, that makes people feel old and tell you how old they feel?</p><p>Then we'll transition into a chat about toys. We reminisce about some of the ones we had (and some of the ones we wanted and didn't get). I fret about the way video games could have devoured me as a little kid, Stephen tells a truly amazing story about Hot Wheels cars, and Kat wisely draws the straight line from toys to Horseland. (That's right: Horseland.)</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about a lovely <a href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2014/06/ask_andrew_wk_when_a_loved_one_dies.php\" target=\"_blank\">piece of writing</a> dealing with sad situations with wisdom and compassion.

Gene is happy about a writer whose work on <a href=\"http://www.believermag.com/issues/201310/?read=article_ghansah\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Chappelle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/03/17/258155902/how-sweet-it-is-to-be-loved-by-you-the-beyhive\" target=\"_blank\">Beyonce</a> and <a href=\"http://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/when-the-lights-shut-off-kendrick-lamar-and-the-decline-of-the-black-blues-narrative\" target=\"_blank\">Kendrick Lamar</a> lit up his week.
