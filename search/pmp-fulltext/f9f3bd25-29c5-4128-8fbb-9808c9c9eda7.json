Witnesses claimed he shot the chemicals into the air like bombs, spurting fumes and smoke to ascend into the sky and convince the cumulus clouds to send down rain.</li><li>He preferred the title &#8220;moisture accelerator.&#8221;</li><li>Hatfield inspired the 1956 film &#8220;The Rainmaker,&#8221; starring Burt Lancaster and Katharine Hepburn.</li><li>On January 1, 1916, the rain started in San Diego and it didn&#8217;t stop for the entire month, resulting in 30 inches of rain. The floods destroyed the dam, washed out roads, lifted railroad tracks, caused property damage across the region and killed an estimated 14 to 50 citizens.</li><li>Hatfield never got his money. The city council claimed the floods were an act of God, not an act of Hatfield.</li></ol><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sb-7RJ3658\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Rick Crawford</strong>, supervisor of special projects at <a href=\"http://www.sandiego.gov/public-library/about-the-library/projects/newcentral.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">San Diego Central Library</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
