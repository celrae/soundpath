She thinks the governor is not doing enough to support California college students.</p><h4>Interview Highlights: <strong>Sadia Saifuddin</strong></h4><p><strong>On why she voted against tuition increases</strong></p><p>&#8221;I feel like the state and the UC has really let down students. A couple of months ago, we had our chancellor increases, which I actually voted for because I believe it takes a certain kind of person to manage our universities; but at the same time almost at every regents’ meeting we are confirming salaries upwards of $300,000 for administrators who, if they were doing the same job at the state level or at some other non-profit, would be making a lot less.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On whether students should share more of the cost burden</strong></p><p>&#8221;It’s hard because you already have low-income students who wouldn’t be able to attend the university, so to ask them to pay for their own tuition, which they can’t do, plus that of others is a little ridiculous. At the same time, we wouldn&#8217;t be in that situation of asking students to share the burden if the state had continued investing in UC.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On what Janet Napolitano could do to alleviate the budget crunch</strong></p><p>&#8221;I would say develop a strategy for long-term for administrative pay, and double your efforts in lobbying at the governor’s office.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Sadia Saifuddin</strong>, senior at the University of California, Berkeley, and student regent on the University of California Board of Regents.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
