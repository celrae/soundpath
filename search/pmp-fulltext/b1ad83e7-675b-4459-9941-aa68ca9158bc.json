He's a <a href=\"http://tomdowney.net/\">freelance magazine writer based in New York</a> and writes primarily about food and travel. In <a href=\"https://medium.com/gone/the-ten-commandments-of-sushi-4eac45192c7d\">The Ten Commandments of Sushi</a>, he conveys the widom of sushi chef Susumu Yajima.</p>\n<p>Yajima-san owns a small, basement sushi restaurant in Tokyo called <a href=\"http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/%E3%82%84%E3%81%98%E3%81%BE-%E6%B8%8B%E8%B0%B7%E5%8C%BA-3\">Yajima Sushi</a>. It's not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi\">world-famous</a>, but it's very very good, he says.</p>\n<p>\"It's the kind of place that you could easily miss if you didn't speak Japanese,\" he says. \"If you didn't known it beforehand and if you weren't aware that down in this basement was this kind-of incredible little world of a sushi chef and his wife and a few customers who eat around their counter.\" </p>\n<p>Downey stumbled upon the restaurant while wandering near the bustling Shibuya train station in Tokyo. Like many travelers, Downey enjoys exploring new places and restaurants off the beaten path. He prefers to look for ones \"that really connect [you] to a place. That aren't three-star Michelin restaurants ... but are places that are extremely local, extremely provincial and express not just the cuisine of a place, but also the culture of a city, of a neighborhood and of a couple of people.\"</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"600\" width=\"900\" alt=\"Patrons watch as Yajima-san gets to work\" title=\"Patrons watch as Yajima-san gets to work\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/SushiChef.JPG?itok=guY2YI8s\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Patrons watch as Yajima-san gets to work</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Tom Downey</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Once Downey found Yajima Sushi, he was ordered to wait, even though there were seats at the counter. Finally, he was given a seat right in front of Yajima. Soon the first piece of sushi arrived and Downey was instructed to eat the sushi, \"Now, Don't wait!.\" Downey discovered this was Yajima-san's first commandment of Sushi: A full meal should take just 10 to 15 minutes. </p>\n<p>It turns out one of the reasons for eating so quickly has origins that date back pre-1964.  </p>\n<div class=\"mediaelement-audio media-element file-default\" info=\"%22media%22%7D\"><audio class=\"mediaelement-formatter-identifier-1430758496-0\" controls=\"controls\" src=\"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/ShusiClip2.mp3\"> </audio></div>\n<p>Another reason for eating so quickly is due to the sushi itself.
