She said Obama, for example, had encouraged Immigration and Customs Enforcement to use prosecutorial discretion to avoid deporting people who came here as children.</p><p>Murguía dismissed that. She said calling him the \"deporter-in-chief\" is not a personal attack, \"it's actually a fact.\"</p><p>\"He has been overseeing an administration that has deported more individuals that any other administration before. And for us, this is really about making that understood,\" Murguía said.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/national-council-of-la-raza-janet-murguia-barack-obama-deporter-in-chief-immigration-104217.html\">In an interview with Politico</a>, Murguía said NCLR had been privately urging the White House to curb deportations, while at the same time publicly blaming Congress and not Obama for the nearly 2 million people deported since Obama took office.</p><p>Today, that changed.</p><p>According to Politico, Murguía will say in her speech tonight that Obama has the power to curb deportations.</p><p>\"He can stop tearing families apart,\" she will say. \"He can stop throwing communities and businesses into chaos. He can stop turning a blind eye to the harm being done. He does have the power to stop this. Failure to act will be a shameful legacy for his presidency.\"</p><p>Of course, Murguía's comments come after prospects for immigration reform dimmed. After the Democrats and the GOP seemed poised to find middle ground on the controversial issue, Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, threw cold water on the prospects, saying it would difficult to find a way forward in 2014.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
