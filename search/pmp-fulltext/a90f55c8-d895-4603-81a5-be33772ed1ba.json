It has a nice drive to it, you feel the passion.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Toots and The Maytals – “In The Dark”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>G Hastings:</strong> The second song, that I’ve picked for the dinner party is…</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Kayus Bankole:</strong> [in a Jamaican accent] Toots and The Maytals!</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>G Hastings:</strong> Toots and The Maytals…</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Kayus Bankole:</strong> [in a Jamaican accent] Toots and The Maytals!</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>G Hastings:</strong> …”In the Dark.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Kayus Bankole:</strong> [in a Jamaican accent] “In The Dark!”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>G Hastings:</strong> Kayus’ Jamaican accent. That’s not what&nbsp;Jamaican sounds&nbsp;like either.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Kayus Bankole:</strong> I know. That’s what Kayus sounds like.</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Oi4wNA9WDBw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>G Hastings:</strong> Anyway, the music is based on gospel. Toots grew up in a&nbsp;gospel choir. It kind of feels like you’re in church. Plus his voice, people used to&nbsp;say he’s&nbsp;was like the reggae Otis Redding.</p>\n<br />\n<p>I think a lot of reggae songs kind of lend themselves to a good party.&nbsp;They’re a good example of how you can feel good and how you can nod your head&nbsp;and you can want to move to it, but if you listen to what they’re saying, it’s not as uplifting as the track feels and I think that’s something that we, as a group, we try and take on board. And I mean especially in this song, “In the Dark,” he’s talking about the darkness.</p>\n<br />\n<p>He says, “Riddle me this/Riddle me that/I bet&nbsp;you don’t know/Just where I’m at.” It sounds like he’s talking about —&nbsp;he doesn’t really believe that someone loves him, who <em>pretends</em> to love him. I could’ve picked any song off of that album to be honest. Toots and the Maytals’ “In the Dark” — it’s one of the <em>best</em> albums ever made. If this was dinner party albums, I would pick that.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Iggy Pop – “Nightclubbing”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Kayus Bankole:</strong> I’ve decided to go for Iggy Pop “Nightclubbing.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5F718vM1hHE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>G Hastings:</strong> I was going to pick that.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Kayus Bankole:</strong> Were you? I just like how it starts in, it’s like [makes beat noises] and the way Iggy comes in, “Nightclubbing.” It sounds sleazy in a <em>good way</em>.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>G Hastings:</strong> When I hear the song, I hear Iggy taking the role of a businessman going to these really fancy nightclubs and just thinking that he owns the world, and he’s&nbsp;the man, and he has no taste in anything really. He’s&nbsp;just a <em>sleaze ball</em>. Kind of sums up “Nightclubbing.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Kayus Bankole:</strong> Oh, it’s just <em>beautiful</em> man, and like it makes sense that he was in Berlin when he was recording that album. He must’ve been <em>soaking</em> in the city.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Young Fathers – “Old Rock n&nbsp;Roll”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>G Hastings:</strong> The song that we pick of our own is “Old Rock n&nbsp;Roll.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/xiQw8fqFh3M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>G Hastings:</strong> It’s&nbsp;about stereotypes, gender stereotypes, and also the history of rock and roll and Congo&nbsp;Square in&nbsp;New Orleans, which is the only place where the slaves would allowed to&nbsp;play music.
