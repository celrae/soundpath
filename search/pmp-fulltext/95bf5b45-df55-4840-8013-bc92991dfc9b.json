Her music video for the song \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im4U8749u8Y\" target=\"_blank\">Rainy Day Woman</a>,\" for example, evokes the technicolor days of the 1960s; with her short-bobbed hair and big eyes that peer out from under an umbrella, Edmonson looks as if she stepped out of <em>Breakfast At Tiffany's</em>.</p><p>Speaking with NPR's Scott Simon, Edmonson — whose new album, <em>The Big Picture</em>, comes out Sept. 30 — says those old movies and musicals are how she got interested in singing to begin with.</p><p>\"I fell in love with the marriage of cinema and music together,\" Edmonson says. \"I remember being 4 years old and thinking that I was just like Gene Kelly on the screen.\"</p><p>These days, however, she draws another comparison: <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/14894617/billie-holiday\" target=\"_blank\">Billie Holiday</a>. It's an enviable association, and one Edmonson says she can't accept outright — though she does see one similarity between herself and Lady Day.</p><p>\"What I understand that she was trying to do with her voice was to emulate a horn, specifically <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15185958/louis-armstrong\" target=\"_blank\">Louis Armstrong</a> playing the trumpet,\" Edmonson says. \"And much of my approach to singing has been similar. I hear myself as an instrument, playing with the band.\"</p><p>Hear the rest of the Edmonson's conversation with NPR's Scott Simon at the audio link.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
