When legislators decided to name the bridge after him in 1940, Giggie says there's no mistaking the message they wanted to send — especially given that the bridge, the gateway to Selma, was a huge engineering improvement over the previous one, an old swing bridge that had to be opened by hand.</p><p>\"They wanted to stamp that — to brand it — with this vision of the South as very much as a ... a world dedicated to white supremacy,\" says Giggie.</p><p>It's something anyone alive here in the '40s or '60s would have known, but not necessarily Selma's younger citizens today.</p><p>Jack Townes, 21, who's lived here his whole life, had no idea until recently.</p><p>\"It came up and I was like, wait, 'Edmund Pettus? That was him?' ... 'I pass by that bridge every day, that's impossible!' \" he says. \"So I Googled it myself and that's what I — that's what I found out.\"</p><p>Townes is part of a local activist group that wants to rename the bridge. But for those who lived here through the '60s — black and white — it's not that straightforward.</p><p>\"The Edmund Pettus Bridge has been there my entire life, and I'm 70 years old — that is part of history, not only in Selma but all over!\" says Norma Lawrence. \"Keep things as a reminder of the bad. If you change them, then you forget them — you forget the bad.\"</p><p>Selma is anything but a city that wants to forget. It's hard to throw a rock here without hitting a plaque to something, though most commemorate the Battle of Selma during the Civil War.</p><p>But it's the bridge that's unique. It's the only marker that has gone from honoring white supremacy to becoming a great monument to racial equality.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
