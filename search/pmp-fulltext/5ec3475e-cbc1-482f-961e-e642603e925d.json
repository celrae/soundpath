Immediately after the girl's removal, her parents and supporters blocked a major highway, posted appeals on social media and took to the airwaves.</p><p>\"That woman [in Texas] only picked out my daughter because of her name and nothing else,\" Gustavo Luna, the girl's father, said on national radio.</p><p>In a different broadcast, the girl's mother cried: \"They stole my daughter.\"</p><p>The parents insisted that authorities must be looking for a different Alondra, who was a year younger and last seen living with her father, a distant relative of theirs.</p><p>Adding to the confusion in the case, a video appeared on Facebook of Alondra Luna, the girl dragged out of the courthouse.</p><p>Nearly drowned out by passing cars, Alondra Luna smiles into the camera and says she's in the U.S. and it's a nice place.</p><p>But with international pressure growing, a DNA test was ordered. It was not a match for the Texas woman's daughter. So on Wednesday, Alondra Luna was flown back and reunited with her parents in Mexico.</p><p>Speaking to reporters, the relieved teen said she thought she was going to end up living in Houston. She said she filmed the video to reassure her parents she was fine and added that the Houston woman told her she had identified her from a picture on her Facebook page.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
