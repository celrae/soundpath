The problem with passwords is human error and having to remember so many of them, says Dug Song, the CEO of <a href=\"https://www.duosecurity.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">Duo Security</a>. He says -- despite repeated warnings -- people use easy passwords over multiple sites. “And so the realization has been that there has to be something strong to protect those accounts,” Song said.\n<p>So tech companies are trying to &nbsp;get rid of the password.

Right now, we do this by using a password. He says, if you sign up for Twitter’s new service, it’ll require a second verification. “You get an SMS message on your cell phone and it’ll have a six digit code and you have to enter it to authenticate yourself,” he said.\n<p>Paypal and lots of “financial institutions” are already making similar services available.
