That video, originally uploaded last November, has received more than 3 million views since Page shared it.</p><p>The Zeppelin medley was the brainchild of Diane Downs, a teacher who runs the Percussionists after school and on weekends.</p><p>Her young musicians play marimbas, vibes, timbales, congas, xylophones and, of course, drums. And they don't just perform rock music — they also play jazz, classical and pop.</p><p>The new-found attention for the small group is \"pretty cool,\" Downs tells NPR.</p><p>\"I want them to feel like rock stars. I want them to realize, 'Oh, this is why we work so hard in rehearsal.' I tell them that when you're presenting something to the public, you don't want it to be okay — you want it to be great,\" she says. \"So hopefully they're going to carry that over into their lives once they grow up, too.\"</p><p>Click on the audio link to hear more about the percussion ensemble.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
