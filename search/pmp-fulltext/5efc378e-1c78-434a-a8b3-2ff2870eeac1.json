The first, which was released this summer on his own <a href=\"http://lostorigins.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lost Origin Productions</a>, is called <em>Nawa: Ancient Sufi Invocations and Forgotten Songs From Aleppo</em>. Hamacher isn't coming at this from the perspective of a musicologist, or as a member of a religious community. He's a drummer who's played in several punk bands in the Washington, D.C., area, including Frodus, Decahedron and Regents.
