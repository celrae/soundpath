Melick tells Wilkins during a StoryCorps interview in Lansing, Kan. \"You know, voices stick with you.\"</p><p>\"Have you been to Kandahar?\" Melick asked Wilkins in the gym that day. \"Did you get blowed up in a Humvee?\"</p><p>\"'Yes, I did,' \" Wilkins said.</p><p>\"'I'm the one pulled you from that Humvee,' \" Melick answered.</p><p>It happened in November 2004, during a mission to defuse IEDs. Melick, filling in as a medic on the mission, was in the Humvee behind Wilkins' vehicle when the explosion came.</p><p>\"The next thing I know, I seen a blue flash,\" Wilkins says. He was severely wounded in the blast.</p><p>\"As I came to your Humvee, the vehicle itself was just pieces.\" Melick recalls. \"I did not expect to find anyone alive. ... I remember pulling you out and saying to you, 'I gotcha.' \"</p><p>\"That stuck in my ear,\" Wilkins says. \"For years I kept hearing this voice: 'I gotcha, I gotcha.' And now I'm sitting before the brother that saved my life.\"</p><p>Neither man wanted to leave the gym after their chance reunion a decade later. In the months since that day, Keith and Roy have spoken on the phone every week.</p><p>\"In my 28 years of the military, and through three different combat zones, you're the first one that I've ever reunited with,\" Melick tells Wilkins. \"Because we [medics] don't know if you'd live or die. To see you today is like watching the angel walk through the door.\"</p><p>\"I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart,\" Wilkins says. \"And I wish I could just take my heart out and show it to you ... it is fluttering with nothing but joy.\"</p><p><em>Produced for </em>Weekend Edition<em> by Andres Caballero.</em></p><p><em>StoryCorps is a national nonprofit that gives people the chance to interview friends and loved ones about their lives.
