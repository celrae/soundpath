Or do you not know because you stopped going? If it&#8217;s yes to either, that could be because it&#8217;s drop-off time.</p><p>Studies have shown that people go gangbusters on their New Year&#8217;s resolutions to lose weight or get fit, but after just a few weeks, not so much.</p><p><em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson spoke with <strong>Richelle Melde</strong>, owner of Ultimate Body Boot Camp in Scottsdale, Arizona, about how to motivate and keep fitness resolutions.</p><p>Her advice for those needing to reset their fitness goals: “The best advice I can give is to get an accountability buddy,” she said.</p><p>She also recommends &#8220;SMART&#8221; goals, which stands for goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely. She also recommends finding a partner to communicate with about goals and progress.</p><h4>7 Tips To Keep That Fitness Resolution in Check</h4><ol><li><strong>Get an accountability buddy.</strong> Confide in one friend or use Facebook or other social media platforms to let your friends keep you accountable for your fitness goals.</li><li><strong>Set SMART goals.</strong> Be specific. Your goals should be measurable and realistic. Think numbers. &#8220;I want to lose 10 pounds,&#8221; or &#8220;I want to run for 30 minutes without stopping.&#8221;</li><li><strong>Money should not be a factor.</strong> If you’re only looking at the cost of a gym membership and not finding value in the goal, then you will not reach your goals. Try group fitness classes. They are more affordable than personal trainers and you have built in accountability buddies.</li><li><strong>Change up your workouts.</strong> Strength training one day and cardio the next will keep your workouts fresh and interesting. After long days at work, try yoga. It will relax your mind and give your muscles time to strengthen and recover.</li><li><strong>You have plenty of time.</strong> If you&#8217;re not training for something, all you need is an hour or even just 30 minutes, three to four days a week.</li><li><strong>Don&#8217;t go overboard with cardio.</strong> Doing a sustained exercise at the same heart rate can actually create a stress state. If you love cardio, mix it up with intervals, rather than endurance.</li><li><strong>Connect with why you&#8217;re doing this.</strong> It’s your driver. You will never achieve your goals if you don&#8217;t know why you are working so hard.</li></ol><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/richellemelde\" target=\"_blank\">Richelle Melde</a></strong>, owner of <a href=\"http://ultimatebodybootcamp.com/pages/home\" target=\"_blank\">Ultimate Body Boot Camp</a> in Scottsdale, Arizona.</li></ul><h4><strong>Related</strong></h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/01/23/low-intensity-activity\">Study: Low-Intensity Activity Can Have Health Benefits</a></li><li><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2015/01/12/running-study-young\">Study: Running May Help Keep You Young</a></li><li><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/04/12/stretching-performance-study\">To Stretch Or Not To Stretch?</a></li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
