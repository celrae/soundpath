More than four dozen House and Senate Democrats said in advance they would not attend the event, a highly unusual move given historically close ties between the two allies.</p><p>The White House expressed its displeasure with the appearance by word and deed, dispatching Vice President Joe Biden on an overseas trip that meant he did not fill his customary seat behind the House rostrum during the speech. Nor did Netanyahu meet at the White House with Obama on his trip to the United States.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRf1cdw4IAY\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/ssp/people/walsh/faculty_walsh.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Walsh</a></strong>, <em>Here & Now</em> security analyst, an expert in international security at MITâ€™s Security Studies Program.
