He's a hearing specialist and surgeon at <a href=\"hopkinsmedicine.org\" target=\"_blank\">Johns Hopkins</a> who performs cochlear implantations. In his free time, he plays sax, piano and bass.</p><p>In search of a better understanding of how the mind processes complex auditory stimuli such as music, Dr. Limb has been working with Dr. Allen Braun to look at the brains of improvising musicians and study what parts of the brain are involved when a musician is really in the groove.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
