Since then, their numbers have fallen off as the political system has become gridlocked.","itags":["npr_api","354187589"],"guid":"0759f839-f507-4403-a19d-176d3bddf74c","contentencoded":"<p><em>This story is part of the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/352990765/new-boom\">New Boom</a> series on millennials in America.</em></p><p>Millennials are not getting much love from politicians this year.</p><p>The big reason for that is low expectations for turnout among young voters.</p><p>Back in 2010, the last midterm election, <a href=\"http://www.civicyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/The-CPS-youth-vote-2010-FS-FINAL1.pdf\">fewer than a quarter</a> of voters ages 18 to 29 showed up at the polls. This year, it's looking even worse: 23 percent of voters under 30 are expected to vote. That's according to Eva Guidarini of the Harvard Institute of Politics, which studies young voters.</p><p>For many years, young voters were not expected to really care about politics, much less get involved.</p><p>That's why the group Rock the Vote was started in 1989, relying on music stars like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt5EuYkBOJI\">Madonna</a> to engage their young fans. And they're still at it, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=rijpU5yD55I\">with an updated set list</a>.</p><p>For a while, it didn't look like millennials would need much convincing. As more members of this generation reached voting age, participation among young voters rose. The peak year was 2008 (<a href=\"http://www.civicyouth.org/youth-turnout-rate-rises-to-at-least-52/#more-323\">52 percent</a>). In 2012, the turnout among voters 18 to 29 dropped to <a href=\"http://www.civicyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CIRCLE_2013FS_outhVoting2012FINAL.pdf\">45 percent</a>.</p><p>On top of that, the rate of voters younger than 30 who could say with certainty that they were registered to vote <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/files/2012/09/9-28-12-2.png\">fell steadily after 2008</a>, according to the Pew Research Center. By 2012, it hit 50 percent — the lowest number Pew has recorded going back as far as 1996.</p><p>Why the big drop? It's not like millennials aren't paying attention. Some say they're easily better informed than past generations.</p><p>Jacob Bell, a 20-year-old student at the University of Maryland, put it this way: \"I can pull up Facebook in front of me and see five different articles about the next Senate race, and that's something that I know my mom's generation never had.\"</p><p>Ashley Spillane, the president of Rock the Vote, says it's no mystery why millennials, or any voters, would be turned off from the process: \"Politics right now is really disheartening. I think it's why you see in the polls that young people are not affiliating with political parties.\"</p><p>(The number of millennials who consider themselves independents has <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2014/03/FT_Millennials_politics_religion.png\">shot up to 50 percent</a>, according to Pew.)</p><p>But Spillane doesn't think that means they are apathetic. \"They do care very passionately about issues that matter to them,\" she says. \"They are getting involved at a local level. They are creating startups. They are volunteering with local organizations. They are looking to take problems on in real time and fix them,\" she says.</p><p>For Rock the Vote, the challenge is reaching a generation that's paying attention to politics — but is simultaneously repelled by what they see.</p><p>While Guidarini is concerned about a generation of voters turned off by politics as they are forming their political identities, she doesn't think all hope is lost: \"I think that if politics starts to change in a direction that I think all of America wants to see it change — not just young people — then you'll see young people get back in the game.\"</p><p>The question is whether politics will improve unless a new generation gets more involved and pushes for that change.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
