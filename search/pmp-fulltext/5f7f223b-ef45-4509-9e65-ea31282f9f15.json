How people had to eat grass because they had no food, and how artillery shells whistled and crashed all night, scorching the sky, and how a couple of times shots from snipers came close enough to our heads to sizzle in our ears as we raced through town to file our stories.</p><p>My uncle, who had been a U.S. Marine in World War II, just heard me through and asked, \"What the hell would you want to do that for?\"</p><p>The murder of James Foley by the Islamic State prompts that question for many people.</p><p>There are lots of jobs in journalism that don't involve risking your life, especially when these days any man or woman with a mobile phone can send news to millions of people. When a tornado strikes or a bomb explodes, people on the scene now bring word of it in words, images, and sounds before professional reporters can even reach for their shoes.</p><p>So why do journalists still go to dangerous places?</p><p>One reason (and no honest answer can avoid this) is professional reward. Covering wars can win attention, respect and awards in a crowded, competitive field, and the reporters acquire a matchless experience that can stamp and propel their careers. This certainly happened to me.</p><p>War reporting is also enthralling, usually more involved than covering, say, a county zoning meeting. You see life illuminated in the glare of death, good and evil, fear and bravery, louts and heroes, all in the same place â€” often all in the same person. It can leave you depressed, but also elated.</p><p>As Jim Foley told an audience at the Medill School of Journalism in 2011, \"When you see something really violent, it does a strange thing to you. It doesn't always repel you. Sometimes, as you know, it draws you close ... It's a strange sort of force.\"</p><p>But this may be a good week to remember that this human mix of motives can also lead to good and noble work. Foley was once a teacher who worked with juvenile offenders. As a freelance reporter, he fought to work in fierce, treacherous places to tell the stories of people who might otherwise not be seen or heard.</p><p>Work that throws light on dark places, and can open minds and reach into hearts, is worth the dedication of a human life.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
