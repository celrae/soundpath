It was booked for a run at Bohemian Caverns — the group had issued a live album made at the nightclub, and it was gearing up to record a follow-up live album. Over walked a waitress, who inquired about the band's predicament.</p><p>Fifty years later, Lewis still remembers her name: Nettie Gray.</p><p>\"She had a jukebox,\" Lewis says. \"Jukeboxes in coffee shops — people don't know about that any more, but she went over to the jukebox and played: 'You guys might like this! Listen to this!'\"</p><p>Her recommendation was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOWO--z1S8A\" target=\"_blank\">\"The In Crowd,\" sung by Dobie Gray</a> — a popular hit at the time. Lewis and the band worked out an arrangement quickly, then ended their set with it that evening, to wild applause.</p><p>Fifty years later, that song remains <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/05/13/406453504/the-in-crowd-an-audience-fueled-jazz-pop-crossover-hit\" target=\"_blank\">Ramsey Lewis' biggest hit</a>.</p><p>\"If somebody had come up with another song that fit the style of what we wanted, there would not have been an 'In Crowd,' \" he says.</p><p>Lewis, now 79 and still actively performing, spoke with NPR's Arun Rath about how the song came to be.
