He says pounding could be heard on the cockpit door during the final minutes of the flight as alarms sounded. He said the co-pilot &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; refused to open the door to let the pilot back in, and his breathing was normal throughout the final minutes of the flight.</p><p>He says passengers could be heard screaming just before the crash.</p><p>The prosecutor says the co-pilot&#8217;s responses, initially courteous, had become &#8220;curt&#8221; when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing.</p><p>He refused to give details on the pilot&#8217;s religion or ethnic background. The prosecutor says German authorities are taking charge of the investigation of the co-pilot, whom he identified as Andreas Lubitz.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/people/17796129/eleanor-beardsley\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Eleanor Beardsley</strong></a>, Paris-based correspondent for NPR.
