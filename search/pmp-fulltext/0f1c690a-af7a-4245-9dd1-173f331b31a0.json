Racial integration didn't come to the major leagues until 1947, when Jackie Robinson broke the color line at first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers.</p><p>But it was another 19 years before a black man, Emmett Ashford, appeared behind home plate. In the interim, black umpires called balls and strikes in the Negro League.</p><p>Motley is the last surviving ump from Negro League baseball. He also served with the first-ever black Marine regiment in World War II, the Montfort Point Marines.</p><p>He tells Tess Vigeland, guest host of NPR's weekends on <em>All Things Considered,</em> that his umpiring career began as he recovered from a gunshot wound at a military hospital on Okinawa.</p><p>\"I could look out the window and see there was a ball field, so I decided I'd hop down with my crutches. And they needed an umpire,\" he says.</p><p>So they gave him a mask and chest protector, and he began calling balls and strikes for the Marines.</p><p>Motley was eventually discharged from the U.S. military with a Purple Heart. When he moved to Kansas City, he went to the nearby stadium and asked if they needed an umpire. The chief umpire initially turned him away.</p><p>\"He said, 'Kid, you don't know nothing about umpiring.' I said, 'I umpired in the Marine Corps,' \" he says. But the chief umpire sent him away.</p><p>He was back the next week, asking again. Eventually, thanks to his determination, he was given a chance to umpire at third base. The president of the league happened to be there and told Motley he did a good job, and offered him a job to start traveling with the league.</p><p>There was one condition: he had to ride on the bus with the players, the same players he'd be making calls against.</p><p>\"Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Satchel Paige; I didn't know at that time they [were] that good,\" he says.</p><p>Ten years into his umpire career, Motley finally went to umpire school in Florida. He was the first black person to do so after, a law in the state banning whites from teaching blacks was lifted.</p><p>Going to umpire school is required to be an ump in the major leagues. But once he graduated, despite finishing at the top of his class, Motley was not offered a job. The only time he got called to the major leagues is when their umpires were on a strike, and Motley was asked to cross the picket line.</p><p>Motley says he asked if he would have a job after the strike was over.</p><p>\"They said, 'We will let you know at that time,' \" he says. \"I said, 'I'll let you know right now, I'm not crossing the picket line then.' \"</p><p>After that, he said he wasn't going to try for the major leagues anymore. But he kept umpiring â€” and eventually, helped found a museum dedicated to preserving the history of the Negro League.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
