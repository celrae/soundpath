But in a speech, Ramirez said risks are growing as connected devices at home transmit and collect vast amounts of private data.</p><p>She <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/one-on-one-with-ftc-chairwoman-edith-ramirez-about-the-internet-of-things/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+arstechnica%2Findex+%28Ars+Technica+-+All+content%29\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> the technology website Ars Technica that companies making these home devices need to be more cautious.</p><p>&#8220;I think companies need to be thinking seriously about it. I think it makes sense from a risk-management perspective because if you think hard about privacy and if you think hard about data security, I think you can avoid problems down the line,&#8221; she said.</p><p>Ramirez said consumers who use smart thermostats and fitness bands may not know if their data is being shared. She added companies should test security measures before home products launch and consider encryption technology to protect sensitive information.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
