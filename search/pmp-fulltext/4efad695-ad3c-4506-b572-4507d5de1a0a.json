These are the moments when everything seems to click, and people leap forward into their careers</em><em>.</em></p><p>Karyn Parsons played Hilary Banks, the bratty, self-centered cousin of Will, on <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em>. Before she got her break on that hit '90s sitcom, Parsons was living in Hollywood — working as a restaurant hostess, taking acting classes and going on lots of auditions.</p><p>Her first role was in a low-budget horror film called <em>Death</em> <em>Spa</em> in the late '80s.</p><p>\"It was a haunted gym,\" Parsons recalls, laughing. \"Mind you, it was a big deal to me at the time, but it was also ... not a whole lot of people saw it. Thank goodness!\"</p><p>When she first got the audition for <em>The</em> <em>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em>, she wasn't sold on the show's concept.</p><p>\"I remember my first reactions being, 'Oh, God, it's a sitcom with a rapper? Like, what's that?' \" she recalls.</p><p>She says the Hilary character was originally written as a polished, cool model.</p><p>\"My first reaction to it was, 'Oh, well, this is ridiculous, I'm not gonna get this, I'm not a model type. This is silly,' \" Parsons says.</p><p>Parsons says she decided to make the character her own. \"I did what I could do, which was, I kind of turned in her into a little bit of a real brat,\" she says.</p><p>\"It was fun to play that girl. It was fun to just be so self-absorbed that you just say ridiculous things.\"</p><p>Parsons got the part, but she still went back to her hostessing job.</p><p>\"I didn't know what was gonna happen with that show,\" she says.</p><p>She remembers Will Smith and others from the show coming by the restaurant while she was working and teasing her outside the window.</p><p>\"Will would say, 'What are you doing here? What is wrong with you?'</p><p>\"And I said, 'I don't know what's gonna happen!' So I just, I stuck with my job. You know, keep your day job — for a while. And then, of course, we got picked up, and that definitely changed everything.</p><p>\"That was definitely my big break. That was a life-changing moment for me and, I believe, for all of us on the show,\" she says.</p><p>The series ran for six seasons — from 1990 to 1996.</p><p>Today, Parsons says she sometimes speaks with the airhead voice she used as Hilary, but she promises it's not on purpose.</p><p>\"Often I meet people at the store or someplace on the street and they say, 'You know who you look like?' And then once I speak, they say, 'It's you! I knew it because of your voice!'</p><p>\"I'm always like, 'No, you didn't. It wasn't my voice! I don't talk like that!' \"</p><p>She snagged some movie roles during breaks in shooting while <em>Fresh Prince </em>was on the air. When the show ended, she took courses in writing and film and co-produced a show called <em>Lush Life. </em>After she got married and started a family, she says, her priorities changed.</p><p>Today, Parsons runs the <a href=\"http://sweetblackberry.org/\">organization Sweet Blackberry</a>, which produces short films for kids about little-known yet influential people in black history. Almost 20 years later, her role on <em>Fresh Prince </em>is still meaningful.</p><p>\"I definitely wouldn't be who I am now if I hadn't had the experience of playing Hilary Banks.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
