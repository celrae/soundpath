You would probably be able to rebook at a later date or choose a different destination. When the Nairobi Airport international terminal burned down earlier this week (although there's no indication it was an act of terror), cancelling flights, British Airways allowed passengers to book flights to alternate destinations or delay their trips. And if a flight was actually canceled, refunds were offered.</p>\n<p><strong>Travel insurance won't help you unless there's an actual terrorist incident in your destination within 30 days of your arrival, or unless you've bought a more expensive \"cancel for any reason\" insurance policy</strong>. And if the destination is a known \"no-go zone,\" with a history of terrorist attacks, you may not be covered either.</p>\n<p><strong>Also, travel insurers have definitions of \"terrorism\" that may not correlate with the U.S. State Department's -- or your own</strong>.
