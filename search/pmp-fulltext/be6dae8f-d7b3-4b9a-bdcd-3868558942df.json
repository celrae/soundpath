Maybe it’s one of those vintage Chevys or Pontiacs from the 1950s in all the tourist photos. But if you go to the island, keep your eyes out for the other car — the Russian Lada. It’s the boxy, no-frills, Soviet-era vehicle that looks like an old Fiat.</p>\n<p>It's rare to see one in the United States, but Fabian Zakharov has one in Miami. And when he needed a new brake pump for it a few years ago, he couldn’t find one—and had to go through the cumbersome process of ordering it from Russia.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-story_image\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/story_main/public/Car_FB2.jpg?itok=oSuUBUks\" width=\"937\" height=\"552\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Russian Moskvich and Lada cars parked at Zakharov Auto Parts, a car parts shop outside of Miami owned by Fabian Zakharov.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"image__credit\">\n    <span class=\"image__credit-label\">\n      Credit:\n    </span>\n    <p>Courtesy of Fabian Zakharov </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Then, he noticed that his Cuban expats friends in Miami had the same need for Russian parts, too, but for cars that their relatives drove in Cuba.</p>\n<p>In Cuba, Ladas still chug around the island — relics from when trade with the Soviets was brisk.

He began small, working from his computer at home helping his Cuban expat friends, one by one, order parts from Russia so that they could take them to Cuba. With demand steady, Zakharov then flew to Russia and struck agreements with car parts manufacturers there. </p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-image_on_right\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/IMG_6504.JPG?itok=Fh_9IGRY\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>In 2010, Fabian Zakharov opened Zakharov Auto Parts in Hialeah, just outside Miami.

He checks out a new starter he needs for a Lada he left behind with a nephew in Cuba, when he moved to Miami seven years ago. The car is now 34 years old, but he says it’s in great condition thanks to the parts he picks up here. And when he’s been unable to get parts to Cuba, he says his family does what a lot of Cubans do. “They improvise and get parts from other cars,” he says. Or, they try to weld together their own parts if possible.\n<p>Throughout the day, business is steady. When there is a lull, Zakharov keeps up with the shop's active <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ladaparts.zakharov\">Facebook</a> page. But he hopes better US-Cuba relations will let him ship directly to Cuba one day and expand his business. “I would be happy if my company moved to Cuba because there are a lot of cars to service with my spare parts,” he says.</p>\n<p>But he doesn’t expect politicians to broker big changes anytime soon. “For now, it’s only conversation,” he says. “We need to wait.”</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"720\" width=\"960\" alt=\"Miami_Car1\" title=\"Miami_Car1\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/Car_FB1.jpg\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>The inside of a 1983 Moskvitch 2140.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"image__credit\">\n    <span class=\"image__credit-label\">\n      Credit:\n    </span>\n    <p>Courtesy of Fabien Zakharov</p>\n  </div>\n</div> \n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/IMG_6543.JPG","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/img6543jpg"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0130201505.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0130201505mp3"}]}
