What happened between the Miller&#8217;s happy January road trip and Sunday&#8217;s shooting will be unraveled by investigators in the coming days and weeks. But interviews with people who knew the couple and the Miller&#8217;s online postings reveal a portrait of a troubled man consumed by a deep hatred of the government and the woman who adored him.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"LA Times Right Wing Extremists \" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-guns-extremism-sovereign-citizen-vegas-20140609-story.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Los Angeles Times</strong>: What will protect us from tyrannical neighbors?</a> &#8211; &#8220;The details out of Las Vegas are chilling: Two extremists declaring a revolution gun down two police officers in cold blood, kill a third person at a nearby Wal-Mart, then kill themselves in an apparent suicide pact during a gun battle with other police officers. An isolated incident? No. Just a few days ago a “sovereign citizen” — part of a movement whose members deny the legitimacy of the government — named Dennis Marx mounted a one-man attack on a Georgia courthouse, wounding a deputy before other officers killed him. His intent, police said, was to take over the Forsyth County Courthouse.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"New Yorker Rogue Element\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/05/26/140526fa_fact_labi?currentPage=all\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The New Yorker</strong>: Rogue Element</a> &#8212; &#8220;Since Barack Obama was elected President, militia groups have proliferated in the United States. In 2010, Daryl Johnson, then a senior domestic-terror analyst at the Department of Homeland Security, found that the number had more than tripled in the past three years, from eighty-five to more than three hundred. The times are conducive to extremist anger: there is a black President, a sputtering economy, a disappearing white majority, and recurring talk of stricter gun laws. According to one expert, the militia movement, which was largely middle-aged in the nineteen-nineties, has recently attracted a surge of younger adherents through social-networking sites.&#8221;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
