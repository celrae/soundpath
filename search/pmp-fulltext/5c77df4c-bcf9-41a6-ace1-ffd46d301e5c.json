The synagogue honors his legacy by replaying the speech once a year.","itags":["npr_api","388691152"],"guid":"5c77df4c-bcf9-41a6-ace1-ffd46d301e5c","contentencoded":"<p>Shortly after winning the Nobel Peace Prize and coming back from Selma, Ala., where residents were protesting discrimination and repeated police brutality, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered a lesser-known speech to a full house at <a href=\"http://www.tioh.org/\" target=\"_blank\">the Temple Israel of Hollywood</a> in Los Angeles in 1965.</p><p>Formally dressed in his dark minister's robes, he told the 1,400 people assembled how much their support meant to those in the thick of the struggle.</p><p>\"We are often given new courage and vigor to carry on when we know that there are friends of good will in the background who are supporting us — and we feel this, day in and day out,\" he told the congregation.</p><p>Initially, King had been scheduled to speak at the temple 20 months earlier, but President John F. Kennedy's assassination postponed that event. This night, mere days after Malcolm X had been assassinated, and days before civil rights activists <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/12/28/373564557/selma-tells-the-civil-rights-story-through-black-eyes\" target=\"_blank\">would march in Selma to demand voting rights</a>, King finally was in Los Angeles.</p><p>He sat between Rabbi Max Nussbaum and philanthropist Bruce Corwin's father, who was the president of the synagogue.</p><p>The soaring sanctuary looked then much as it does today. Its velvet-covered chairs face a podium dominated by the temple's ark, which holds a Torah rescued from a Berlin temple as it was being torched by the Nazis.</p><p>Corwin, a Temple Israel member since birth, was a college student in 1965 and remembers the evening vividly.</p><p>\"His voice — he modulated his voice so magnificently,\" he says. \"It was just thrilling to hear how he — the highs and the lows of the way he handled his voice.\"</p><p>That night, King spoke about many things, including income inequality abroad and at home.</p><p>\"There are some 40 — between 40 and 50 — million of our brothers and sisters in this country who are poverty-stricken,\" King told them. \"There they find themselves perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. Certainly, if we are to be a great nation, we must solve this problem.\"</p><p>King so impressed his audience, Corwin says, that collectively, they donated the largest contribution ever gathered at a Sabbath service.</p><p>His 1965 visit came at a time of rising racial tension, and the same is true today. But the temple plays King's speech every year, Corwin says, and his words are a reminder that the struggle for justice is ongoing — and that the effort is worthwhile.</p><p>\"History has a way of repeating itself — I mean, look at Ferguson, look at New York, look at what's going on,\" he says. \"And we've come a long way, and yet have a long way to go.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
