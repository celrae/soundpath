The class of 2015 can't be blamed if they're feeling a little worried: They're facing one of the most important transitions of their lives.</p><p>In a matter of months, they're about to launch from the relatively protected confines of college into the so-called \"real world,\" where they have to find a sense of purpose — not to mention a paycheck. It's not hyperbole to say the decisions they make now will shape the rest of their lives.</p><p>NPR's <em>Weekend Edition </em>wanted to tap into the challenges facing our 2015 seniors, as well as their preoccupations. So we're going to follow four people — two men and two women — from Howard University in Washington, D.C., just a couple miles from NPR headquarters.</p><p>For a series we're calling \"The Howard Project,\" these four students have agreed to give us a window into the questions they're grappling with as they think about their future. They'll be keeping an audio diary over the next few months — and for their first entries, we've asked them to introduce themselves however they like.</p><p><em>Click the audio link above to hear their introductions, or read on to learn more about Ariel Alford, Taylor Davis, Kevin Peterman and Leighton Watson.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
