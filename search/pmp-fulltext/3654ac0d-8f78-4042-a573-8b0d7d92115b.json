At least one man couldn't be happier about the return of insects — especially the ones that hurt.</p><p>University of Arizona entomologist Justin Schmidt has spent three decades traveling the globe collecting ants, bees and wasps to develop the <a href=\"http://io9.com/5912008/the-ten-most-painful-insect-stings-as-measured-by-science\" target=\"_blank\">Schmidt Sting Pain Index</a>. It ranks pain on a scale of one to four, with four being the worst. Schmidt has been stung well over 1,000 times and ranked 78 different insects.</p><p>\"The sting pain scale was basically a scientific tool because I had no numbers for pain,\" he says. \"You know, people just said, 'Oh, ouch that really hurt!' Or, 'Gee that really agonized me!' Those you can't put into a computer and compare them.\"</p><p>The most painful? The tropical bullet ant. He describes it as a \"branding iron or a bolt out of nowhere.\"</p><p>Despite all he has endured, Schmidt says he's no masochist. He just figures being stung is the price he must pay to know more about insects — and how they use pain to survive.</p><p><em>Listen to the full story above.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
