Bill Prindle is the acting director.\n<blockquote><strong>BILL PRINDLE:</strong> We estimated that cumulatively, through 2020, we could save about $4.4 billion in electric bills.</blockquote>\nThat's roughly $1 saved for every American.<br />\n<br />\nBut while the changing clocks have gotten all the attention, Prindle says other provisions from the same 2005 energy bill have much more financial significance.\n<blockquote><strong>PRINDLE:</strong> There are energy efficiency standards that will save 15 times as much money, energy and carbon as the Daylight Savings Time measure itself.</blockquote>\nMuch of the savings comes from new appliance standards.<br />\n<br />\nAnd consumers can save money by taking advantage of energy-friendly tax incentives, but Prindle cautions that time is running out.
