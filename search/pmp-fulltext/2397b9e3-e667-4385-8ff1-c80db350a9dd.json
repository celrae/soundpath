(Grab a sheet of paper and you can follow along, step-by-step, <a href=\"http://www.edu.jaxa.jp/materialDB/downloadfile/79055.pdf\">here</a> or in this youtube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aizlpy21wiY\">video</a>.)</p><p>The folded sheet looks a bit like the folded maps you can buy at gas stations. But instead of multiple steps to unfold it, all you need to do is grasp the corners of the paper and pull. It's simple — and simplicity is key when designing a spacecraft.</p><p>\"If I was deploying [a solar panel] in space,\" Trease says, \"I would only need one motor to do that deployment. That's the beauty of the design.\"</p><p>And the usefulness of origami in space exploration doesn't end with <a href=\"http://www.origami-resource-center.com/origami-science.html#solarSail\">solar panels</a>.</p><p>For example, we can now print things like electronic circuits, solar cells and displays directly onto sheets of paper, Trease says, and scientists are <a href=\"http://www.origami-resource-center.com/origami-science.html\">devising ways</a> take these sheets and fold them up into into useful instruments — such as seismometers or atmospheric detectors.</p><p>\"What really excites me is the idea of just sending the entire printer up into orbit,\" Trease says. Then if you needed a different sensor, he explains, you could just upload the design and print out a new one in space.</p><p>\"There are folks here,\" he says, \"interested in what we call printable spacecraft.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
