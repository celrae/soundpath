All of this has to be a uniformed, concerted effort. We know there have been insufficient guidelines issued, and certainly no enforcement mechanisms.&#8221;</p><p>Castillo says hospitals have inadequately prepared their nurses and other healthcare workers for the possibility of an Ebola patient, but that doesn&#8217;t have to be the case.</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re asking for the hospitals to prepare by engaging in a robust interactive education and training drill with the nurses and the healthcare providers and workers who are going to be interfacing directly with these patients as they come in,&#8221; Castillo said. &#8220;We have the resources in this country. This is not West Africa. We should not have another patient, nurse or healthcare worker infected.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Bonnie Castillo</strong>, the director of the disaster response network for National Nurses United.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
