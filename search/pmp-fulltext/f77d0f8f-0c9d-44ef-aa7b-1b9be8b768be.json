This particular series has gotten pretty unhappy reviews from a lot of critics, but I acknowledge — and I acknowledge in this episode — that I vary from that opinion and mostly like it. I don't think it's particularly acidic satire, but it did make me chuckle.</p><p>There's a lot of cross-pollination between backstage satire and the making of ironic cameos, so perhaps it makes sense that we paired <em>The Comedians </em>with a discussion of cameo appearances. When are they distracting? When do they help? What can they bring to the table?</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week.
