Andrews and Dr. Austen Holland, state seismologist, said the rate of earthquakes and geographical trends around major oil and gas drilling operations that produce large amounts of wastewater indicate the earthquakes &#8220;are very unlikely to represent a naturally occurring process.&#8221;</p><p>The survey said the &#8220;primary suspected source&#8221; of the temblors is not hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is the practice of injecting fluid under high pressure to create cracks in deep-rock formations so natural gas and oil will flow more freely during drilling. It said the source is more likely the injection in disposal wells of wastewater produced as a byproduct of fracking.</p><p><strong>Joe Wertz</strong> has been <a href=\"http://stateimpact.npr.org/oklahoma/2015/04/21/state-seismologist-oklahoma-earthquakes-very-likely-triggered-by-oil-and-gas-disposal-wells/\" target=\"_blank\">writing about this</a> for StateImpact Oklahoma and joins <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young with details.</p><ul><li><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/06/24/oklahoma-earthquakes-fracking\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Austen Holland talks about the dramatic increase in earthquakes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://earthquakes.ok.gov/\">Oklahoma earthquake information</a></li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://stateimpact.npr.org/oklahoma/author/joewertz/\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Wertz</a></strong>, reporter for <a href=\"http://stateimpact.npr.org/oklahoma/\" target=\"_blank\">StateImpact Oklahoma</a>.
