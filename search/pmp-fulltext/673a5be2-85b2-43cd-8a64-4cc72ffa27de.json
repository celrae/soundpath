We both come from very vibrant, rich scenes â€” he's from California and I'm from Argentina. Those can also be very hermetic scenes that are like worlds unto themselves. So it took us awhile to even consider each other's tastes. For the longest time Felix would wrinkle his nose when I'd offer him a spoonful of South American pop or Spanish punk; and I'd eye anything related to <em>rancheras</em> with suspicion.</p><p>But good music is good music, and it eventually breaks down all barriers.
