The company is committed to improve aircraft fuel efficiency by blending fossil fuels with biofuels, and use lighter-weight materials and winglets to reduce drag.</p><p>Just last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it will take steps to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from airplanes. The EPA says the emissions threaten human health because they contribute to climate change.</p><p>The EPA says it will wait for the United Nations agency &#8211; the International Civil Aviation Organization &#8211; to develop international standards which are expected to be completed next year.
