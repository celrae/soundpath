Those are still available to service members, and in some cases aggressively sold to them. Some payday and title lenders have found ways to exploit gaps in the MLA, offering longer-term high-interest installment loans, sometimes backed by a car-title, that are not illegal but can send service members into a deepening spiral of debt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That’s what happened to Mark and Lisa Gerber, of Hinesville, Ga. Mark is an MP on the Fort Stewart Army base. He’s 36, she’s 30, they have three young children. They’ve owned a house, cars, motorcycles. Now they live in a rundown ranch house off-base. And they’ve been through bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The problems started when Mark got a base transfer to Georgia several years ago. They tried to rent the house they owned in Missouri, but their renter—also military—also got transferred, and soon they were having trouble keeping up the mortgage. The house was underwater so they couldn’t sell. They took out an installment loan from <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/beyond-payday-loans-installment-lending-and-cycle-debt/lucrative-installment\">World Finance</a>, and at least one other cash loan, this one from an internet payday lender that proved fraudulent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“And then they called us and said they were foreclosing on the house,” says Lisa, of their troubles.</p>\n<p>Mark chimes in: “I deployed shortly after that, so fighting it in court and going through that whole battle wasn’t really an option. And I didn’t want to leave that burden on my wife, so we just filed bankruptcy. And it just kept going down and down, and ultimately we lost our house, I lost my car, pretty much everything.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gerber’s chain of command knows about the bankruptcy, and his officers have been supportive so far. But he worries about his security clearance — up for renewal soon — and his future career in the military.</p>\n<p>They still struggle from time to time to pay the bills. In fact, they’ve continued to take out military installment loans on occasion to pay for Christmas gifts or small extras they need. They plan to pay it all back, on time, without rolling the loans over, they say.</p>\n<p><strong>Soldiers: A&nbsp;financially vulnerable population</strong></p>\n<p>Members of that military chain of command are certainly cognizant that they have a financially vulnerable population under their management.

That’s to welcome the troops home after stressful, repeated deployments, and finally relax back into civilian life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Then, the debt-dunning would start: letters from lenders, calls to home, calls to the base looking for commanding officers, says Archuleta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“On a good day I would be notified by the soldier that a payday lender was looking for them because they are in default,” says Archuleta. “On a bad day, it would be almost like an ambush.
