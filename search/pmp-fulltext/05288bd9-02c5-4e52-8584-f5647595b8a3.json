His first book, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-difflMkVVE\"><em>Man of War: My Adventures in the World of Historical Reenactment</em></a>, comes out next week. He tells us about what he learned from traipsing through the past…and then gives us a list of three of his favorite hysterical historical works.</p>\n<br />\n<p>-<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnLqLHWDg5E\">The 2,000 Year-Old-Man</a>, by Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner<br />\n<br />\n-<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/05/reviews/980405.405blnt.html\">Confederates in the Attic</a>, by Tony Horowitz<br />\n<br />\n-<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9VEudeT53k\">Blackadder</a>, by Richard Curtis, Rowan Atkinson and Ben Elton</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong><br />\n<br />\nEtiquette: Christopher Buckley</strong><br />\n<br />\nSatirist Christopher Buckley has lampooned life, politics, and culture in a dozen acclaimed books, including the recent bestseller <em>Thank You For Smoking</em>. He’s also the author of the memoir <em>Losing Mum and Pup</em>, in which he reflects on his mother Patricia and his father William, the late founder of modern American conservative thinking. Buckley’s new venture <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/books/review/they-eat-puppies-dont-they-by-christopher-buckley.html\"><em>They Eat Puppies, Don’t They</em></a> (out this month) tackles the strained relations between the U.S. and China, to hilarious effect. We ask the diplomatic writer to counsel us about dog food, smoking currency, and <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204661604577186843056231170.html\">the Icelandic dish</a> Anthony Bourdain described as “the single worst, most disgusting and terrible tasting thing.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong><br />\n<br />\nChattering Class: Rich Sommer, Mad about Board Games</strong><br />\n<br />\nRich Sommer holds a day job at the fictional Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce agency — he plays <a href=\"http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men\">Mad Men</a>’s awkward, bespectacled <a href=\"http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men/cast/harry-crane\">Harry Crane</a>. Starting this weekend, he returns to his stage roots for the the new, hotly-anticipated Broadway rendition of <a href=\"http://www.broadway.com/shows/harvey/\">Harvey</a> (which started previews this week). But in addition to playing characters… Sommer plays board games. In fact, according to his game-geek <a href=\"http://games.richsommer.com/\">blog</a>, he field-tested 261 different ones last year alone. Rich tells Rico why he’s addicted, schools him on the latest game trends, and explains why “roll and move” is the last thing any self-respecting gamer would ever deign to do.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong><br />\n<br />\nLetters: You!</strong><br />\n<br />\nWe empty the mailbag and voicemail inbox, highlighting your input on dirt-cheap caviar, ‘under the table’ dealings, and drunk dialing.

Since then, he’s made everything from cult classics like “<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6XIGZ51VMo&amp;feature=relmfu\">Dazed and Confused</a>” to the animated sci-fi <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnXk_ykK_bw\">“A Scanner Darkly”</a> to the thoughtful romances “<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQpYHiB0k6k\">Before Sunrise</a>/Before Sunset” and the crowd-pleasing “<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa8U0nL-KXg\">School of Rock</a>.” Richard’s latest, <a href=\"http://movies.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/movies/bernie-with-jack-black-and-shirley-maclaine.html\">“Bernie,”</a> (out now) reunites him with Jack Black for a can’t-believe-it’s-true crime comedy set in his native East Texas.
