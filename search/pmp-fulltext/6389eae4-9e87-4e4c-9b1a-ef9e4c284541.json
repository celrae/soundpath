One of the riders, 13-year-old <strong>Jamie Buis</strong>, told <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young that the experience of caring for her dying horse has made her stronger.</p><h4>Interview Highlights</h4><p><strong>On &#8220;spa days&#8221; for the horses</strong></p><p>“A couple times a week, we have some of the younger girls come in and groom and bathe and give treats and just take care of all the horses.”</p><p>“I’ve been going every day to see my horses. We give them a lot of baths, rinse them off if they’re hot. We brush them a lot, give them lots of treats, and give them lot of hay—make them as comfortable as possible and happy.”</p><p><strong>On her horse, Ultimatum</strong></p><p>“When you own a horse you have a connection with them that you can’t really explain to people who don’t have horses. And it’s really incredible when you get on, the relationship that you have on the ground with them – it translates over into riding. The horses are more willing to work for you when they love you and like your company.”</p><p><strong>On how this experience has changed her</strong></p><p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize how much I appreciate my horse. I&#8217;ve never been through something harder. If you told me a couple of months ago what would&#8217;ve happened, I would&#8217;ve laughed and said, &#8216;Oh, I can&#8217;t handle that.&#8221; I realize how much stronger I am now.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Jamie Buis</strong>, 13-year-old equestrian who is among those caring for the dying horses.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
