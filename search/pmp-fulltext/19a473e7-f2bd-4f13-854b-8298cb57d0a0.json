It's cleaner and lacks the discrete embellishments of fonts like Times New Roman.</p><p>Times New Roman is trickier.

Don't use it on your resume \"unless you are applying to clown college,\" Hoff says.</p><p>Emoticons are an easy way to express ourselves in informal settings. So, is emoji use off the table in resumes? \"I think it's a great idea,\" Luckhurst says. \"Maybe an emoji is your logo.\"</p><p>Who knows, maybe it's the new \"skills\" category.
