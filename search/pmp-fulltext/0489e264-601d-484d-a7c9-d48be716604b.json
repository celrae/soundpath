But too many healthy people are taking the drug for prevention, and for them, the risks may outweigh benefits.","itags":["npr_api","402039544"],"guid":"0489e264-601d-484d-a7c9-d48be716604b","contentencoded":"<p>We've all heard that an aspirin a day can keep heart disease at bay. But lots of Americans seem to be taking it as a preventive measure, when many probably shouldn't.</p><p>In a recent national survey, more than half the adults who were middle age or older reported taking an aspirin regularly to prevent a heart attack or stroke. The Food and Drug Administration only <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm390574.htm\">recommends</a> the drug for people wh have already experienced such an event or are at extremely high risk.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%2814%2900661-8/abstract\">survey</a>, published in the <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine, </em>found that 52 percent of people ages 45 to 75 are taking aspirin daily or every other day. And 47 percent are taking it even though they have never had a heart attack or stroke.</p><p>\"That's very controversial in the medical community,\" says <a href=\"http://pharmacy.oregonstate.edu/user/61\">Craig Williams</a>, a pharmacologist at Oregon State University, who led the study.</p><p>Aspirin thins the blood and can help prevent blood clots that can clog blood vessels and cause strokes and heart attacks. But long-term use of the drug also increases the risk of ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding and bleeding in the brain.</p><p>\"Everyone agrees that for people who have already had a cardiac event, the benefits outweigh the risk,\" Williams says.</p><p>But for most other people, the chance that aspirin will prevent a first heart attack is about equal to the chance that it will cause harmful side effects, research suggests.</p><p>The American Heart Association <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/PreventionTreatmentofHeartAttack/Aspirin-and-Heart-Disease_UCM_321714_Article.jsp\">says</a> aspirin should be used only for prevention when someone's risk for heart disease is especially high.</p><p>And Williams says that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is in the process of revising its <a href=\"http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-for-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-preventive-medication\">recommendation</a>, which currently holds that older men and women should generally take aspirin if their risk for heart attack outweighs the risk of bleeding due to the medication.</p><p>In the survey by Williams' team, about 43 percent of people said they were taking the drug for prevention without having consulted a physician. That's a bad idea, says <a href=\"http://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff_directory/staff_display?doctorid=1185\">Steve Nissen</a>, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic who wasn't involved in the study.</p><p>\"The vast majority of people in America who take aspirin for prevention are what I like to call the 'worried well,' \" Nissen says. \"They are perfectly healthy. They may not even have a lot of risk factors. But they're very health conscious. And somebody told them that aspirin was good for preventing heart attacks, so they just started taking it.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
