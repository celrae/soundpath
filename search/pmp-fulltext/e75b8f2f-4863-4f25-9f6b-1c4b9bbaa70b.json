That's the question on an ad that has provoked a backlash against a British company that opponents say is body-shaming consumers, instead of helping them get fit.","contentencoded":"<p>There's a huge poster showing a Barbie doll-figured model that's currently all over the London Underground.</p>\n<p>The ad is for a diet supplement called Protein World, and supporters says it motivates consumers to get fit and healthy. But many others say it's simply body-shaming, and the ad has fired up debates on Twitter and Facebook about whether it's offensive.</p>\n<p>It's also prompted an <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/proteinworld-arjun-seth-remove-are-you-beach-body-ready-advertisements?utm_source=action_alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=293131&amp;alert_id=nihHZAcfNA_%2F5mNCxo1oC2y9xQywRMmzp4kL8Uc6McjG3JmLGCwKrY%3D\">online petition</a> to have the posters removed. Juliette Burton signed it.</p>\n<p>“This poster is one of many that I’m sure everyone in the UK and America has to deal with,” she says. ”It’s a daily irritant, this kind of body-shaming. It’s a background noise that can really exacerbate self-esteem problems or mental health problems.”</p>\n<p>But signing the petition and posting her support on Twitter for the removal of the poster brought the noise front and center. \"Protein World immediately responded saying, ‘Why make your insecurities our problem?’ [adding a] winky face emoji,\" Burton says. \"I was quite taken aback when I saw that.”</p>\n<p>That promted a heated exchange between Protein World's CEO, Arjun Seth, and Twitter users supporting Burton.</p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"453\" width=\"580\" alt=\"Twitter exchange over Protein world ads\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-24%20at%2021%2056%2046.jpg?itok=l874mHqe\" title=\"\" /><span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Juliette Burton</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Burton has long been a body image campaigner <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-ouch-32497580\">after she struggled with anorexia, compulsive eating and bulimia</a>.</p>\n<p>“I’m very open about my mental health problems, because I personally feel that there is nothing wrong, there is no shame,\" Burton says. \"In fact, my mental health problems have taught me a lot about empathy, about how to treat people, about psychology, about my own self-awareness. I feel it’s important to be open about it because I believe that’s how we can break stigma.”</p>\n<p>Seth wasn't the only one who mocked Burton online; others posting insults called her fat, ugly and crazy.
