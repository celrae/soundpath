And the way that Muslims talk about this is to say, &#8216;They can&#8217;t be Muslims. They certainly can&#8217;t represent my religion. My religion doesn&#8217;t do those things, doesn&#8217;t condone those things.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>Among the pilots whose faces and names were released include the United Arab Emirates&#8217; first female fighter jet pilot, Maj. Mariam al-Mansouri and Saudi prince <span style=\"color: #282828\">Khaled bin Salman. Both have received death threats.</span></p><p>&#8220;The bet was right to show that the royal sons were in those cockpits,&#8221; Amos said of the Saudis. &#8220;I think the message to their own people was &#8216;We are putting royal sons on the front lines. That&#8217;s how serious we think this is.&#8221;</p><p>Meantime, 140,000 Syrian Kurds have crossed into Turkey as they flee ISIS fighters. Amos said the United Nations is airlifting aid into the border for the refugees.</p><p>ISIS is moving south of the Syrian city Kobani, near the Turkish border, but Kurdish forces are engaged in battle to hold them back.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul style=\"color: #000000\"><li><strong><a style=\"color: #2c95c7\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/people/2100182/deborah-amos\" target=\"_blank\">Deborah Amos</a></strong>, international correspondent for NPR.
