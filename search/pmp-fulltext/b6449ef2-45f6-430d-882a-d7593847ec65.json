Jon Meadows' first deployment to Iraq, one of his friends, Staff Sgt. William Beardsley, said he wanted to go on a mission in Jon's place.</p><p>Jon agreed â€” and Beardsley died on that mission.</p><p>\"That was the hardest moment of my life,\" Jon tells his wife, Melissa, on a visit to StoryCorps in Washington, D.C. \"I was ashamed, because I was glad it wasn't me. Then I had the guilt ... If I went on the mission, it wouldn't have been him. I had a picture of him, and I had it everywhere I went. And now I put him on my bookshelf. There's my buddy who got killed. I can never get over that.\"</p><p>Jon was injured multiple times during his service. During his most recent deployment, in Afghanistan, the vehicle he was riding in drove right over an IED.</p><p>\"My driver floored it,\" Jon tells Melissa. \"And my body slammed so hard up against the top of the vehicle it felt like I had a knife stuck in, like, the middle of my brain.\"</p><p>When he came home, they learned he'd suffered a traumatic brain injury. \"You couldn't have a conversation,\" Melissa tells Jon. \"You couldn't follow one-step instructions. You were almost catatonic at times.\"</p><p>Jon asks if Melissa would ever want to give up on him. \"No,\" Melissa tells him. \"Absolutely not. Your mission is to get better.\"</p><p>\"And that's what I'm trying to do,\" Jon says. \"And it's so hard to say, 'I need help.' \"</p><p>\"I can't soldier it up anymore,\" he says. \"I have to be somebody that wants to be healed. And now we're working with my PTSD, which is a different thing. The only way to treat that is I have to talk about it, too.\"</p><p><em>Audio produced for</em> Weekend Edition<em> by Katie Simon.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
