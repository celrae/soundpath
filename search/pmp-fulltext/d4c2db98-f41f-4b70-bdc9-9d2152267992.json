The second thing is, it&#8217;s Hawaii &#8212; we&#8217;ve got a lot of sunshine throughout the year. And, you know, the third thing is help from the state and our policy makers who have created tax breaks and subsidies. And so you corral those three things together, and you&#8217;ve got the perfect storm, although, as you&#8217;ve noted, it has led to some issues, especially with integrating to our utilities grid here.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the energy savings by Hawaiians who switch to solar</strong></p><p>&#8220;If you go solar, your bill will drop &#8212; you know, whether you have a several hundred dollar [electric] bill, or some bills are in the thousands of dollars range, depends how big of a family you have. The average bill after you go solar, though, is around $15-17, so even if your bill is about a hundred bucks a month, I mean, that&#8217;s quite  a savings in itself.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On how the grid infrastructure updates will get paid for</strong></p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tough dilemma, and I think our Public Utilities Commission is, you know, right in the middle of it, you know, in trying to make sure it&#8217;s fair. You know, it&#8217;s a process that is involved, all the stakeholders, so we can figure out a way, you know, a fair way for the grid improvements to be done. That&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re currently going through right now, and to, you know, who gets to pay for all those improvements. There are some costs that the utility does pass on to the customers, and just recently, they came out with a bill increase, and that&#8217;s specifically for renewable energy improvements, and so that&#8217;s starting to happen as well.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/bio/7101/Duane+Shimogawa\" target=\"_blank\">Duane Shimogawa</a></strong>, covers energy, real estate and economic development for Pacific Business News.
