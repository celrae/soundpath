So I’m in level 66 to death. We have five people. I came in fifth, but I did have one third place ordinal, so I feel really good about that.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On why she started skating so late in life</strong></p><p>&#8220;My mother was a skater. I used to watch her do figures on a pond when we lived in Chicago. And after she passed away, I went down and enrolled in figure skating classes because I felt that was a way of keeping her presence around me. I was close to 50 &#8211; 48 or 49 I think.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On what she&#8217;s focusing on in her skating</strong></p><p>&#8220;Right now it’s mostly just trying to do good skating skills. I can’t really do a lot of the jumps or the spins because I had a stroke a few years ago.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It’s been challenging, I can say that, but I really feel like skating has helped in my recovery.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;I really feel like skating has helped in my recovery.&#8221;</p><p></div></p><p>&#8220;A few years after I started was when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It really helped me emotionally get through the ordeal because I was able to skate every morning before I went to radiation. It gave me a desire to want to come back and skate.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On why she loves to skate</strong></p><p>&#8220;It just feels like it’s a combination of feminine creativity and masculine energy. So I feel like the best of myself is really being expressed.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Patricia McNamara</strong>, figure skater.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
