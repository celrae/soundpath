[and] she was trying to find the father of her latest child,\" Shteyngart recalls.</p>\n<p>The woman was from the village of Bolsheorlovskoe, 300 miles from Moscow. Shteyngart says what was surprising, was that \"everyone just insulted her over and over again.\"</p>\n<p>And the woman did nothing to defend herself.</p>\n<p>\"In a Jerry Springer-type show, you would expect her to fight back, name calling and bleeping of curse words, but she sat there like a heroine out of Dostoyevsky and just took the punches,\" Shteyngart says.</p>\n<p>To Shteyngart, this episode is emblematic of Russia in general.</p>\n<p>\"People don’t respond back,\" he says. \"They’re told what the truth is and they accept it and there’s no fighting back.\"</p>\n<p>The exception, according to Shteyngart, comes from very small populations, especially younger people.</p>\n<p><em>Read Shteyngart's complete story in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/out-of-my-mouth-comes-unimpeachable-manly-truth.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=1#\">New York Times Magazine</a>.</em></p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-02-20%2Fauthor-spent-seven-days-watching-russian-state-tv-he-survived-barely&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/Shteyngart_Crop_0.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/shteyngartcropjpg-0"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0220201508.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0220201508mp3"}]}
