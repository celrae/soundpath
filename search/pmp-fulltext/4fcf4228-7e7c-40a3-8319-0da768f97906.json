Matchen worked on the documentary with fellow filmmakers <strong>Susan Gray </strong>and <strong>Andrew Kukura</strong>.</p><p>&#8220;It just happened that Guillaume Saladin, who was a performer for Montreal, had been visiting there at the time. And he went back to his circus in Montreal, Cirque Éloize, and began thinking about this, thinking, ‘What can I do to help?’&#8221;</p><p>Saladin had grown up in Igloolik. He decided to recruit some of his acrobatic friends and went back to his home community to start Artcirq.</p><p>Meanwhile, his friend and Cirque Éloize colleague Yamoussa Bangoura also dreamed of returning to his home country to empower young people through circus arts. Like Igloolik, the Guinean capital of Conakry has desperately few jobs to offer its young people.</p><p>Bangoura started a circus called <a href=\"http://kalabante.org/wp/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Kalabante</a>. The documentary explores the alliance between these two circuses a world apart.</p><p><div  class=\"l-article-media\" style=\"height:351px; padding-bottom:10px;\">            <div class=\"responsive-media\" style=\"height:351px; padding-bottom:10px;\">                <iframe style=\"height:351px; padding-bottom:10px;\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/124206024?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\"></iframe>            </div>        </div><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/staff/matchan\" target=\"_blank\">Linda Matchan</a></strong>, documentary filmmaker and feature writer for The Boston Globe.
