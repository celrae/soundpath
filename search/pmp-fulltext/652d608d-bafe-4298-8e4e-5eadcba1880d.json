There's a majesty and intimacy in her voice â€” immense as the Grand Canyon yet warm and confidential. The five-time Grammy winner is one of the most celebrated opera singers of our time. This year she published a memoir called <em>Stand Up Straight and Sing!</em> Last week she <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7rkTYFN6h8\" target=\"_blank\">sang \"Midnight Special\"</a> on David Letterman's <em>Late Show </em>and was feted like royalty at the Metropolitan Opera Guild's annual luncheon.</p><p>In this informal session of music and conversation, the soprano recalls her childhood in Augusta, Ga., where she found inspiration in an old 78 by the legendary <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/102980721/marian-anderson\" target=\"_blank\">Marian Anderson</a>, whom she later befriended.
