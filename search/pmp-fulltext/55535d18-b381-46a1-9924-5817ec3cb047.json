We talk about food for the soul and food for the glutton, and we learn a fascinating biographical tidbit about Kat.</p><p>Our other topic this week is college â€” a matter into which Kat helps us transition seamlessly, it must be said. We talk about how culture looks not only at college but at the idea of going to college and its connection to what Gene calls a pop culture without any notion of class.</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about <a href=\"http://thatbadadvice.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a Tumblr he likes</a> as well as a single to which you may find yourself toe-tapping.
