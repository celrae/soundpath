Ambushes were the leading cause of gun deaths &#8212; three times as many officers died in ambushes this year compared with last year. However that number is equal to the number of officers killed in ambushes in 2012.</p><p>This year&#8217;s report comes amid increased tensions between police officers and communities after the deaths of unarmed black men by white police officers and the ambush killings of two NYPD officers.</p><p>But<strong> Craig Floyd</strong>, chairman and CEO of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, tells <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org\"><em>Here & Now&#8217;</em></a>s Lisa Mullins that the majority of people who kill law enforcement officers are anti-government vigilantes.</p><p>&#8220;Fifteen of those officers who were gunned down were killed in ambush style attacks,&#8221; Floyd said. &#8220;This is the highest figure we&#8217;ve seen since 1995, and I think, unfortunately, that it&#8217;s reflective of an anti-government sentiment that&#8217;s been prevalent here in America for sometime now.&#8221;</p><p>Floyd notes that these ambushes have been the leading cause of death for law enforcement officers for five years in a row &#8212; who pose visible targets.</p><p>&#8220;Who is the most visible, the most vulnerable symbol of government in America? It&#8217;s the law enforcement officers patrolling our streets,&#8221; Floyd said.</p><p>Floyd says that better mental health services might be one aspect of improving officers&#8217; safety, saying that a number of the people who kill officers are mentally unstable.</p><p>&#8220;Mental illness is a real problem in this country,&#8221; Floyd said. &#8220;And when they have access to firearms, that&#8217;s a deadly mix.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/about/chairman/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Craig Floyd</strong></a>, chairman and CEO of the <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/\" target=\"_blank\">National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund</a>.</li></ul><h4><strong>Related</strong></h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/12/31/cohen-deadly-force\">Congressman: Government Should Track Police Deadly Force Cases</a></li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
