But when a Mexican filmmaker chose Arcos to be a subject in a documentary on successful Mexicans in the United States, how could he refuse?","contentencoded":"<p>Journalists love to tell stories, but they're not always fond of being the subject. But that's exactly what happened to radio producer <a href=\"http://bettoarcos.com/about/\">Betto Arcos</a>, who frequently covers music from Latin America for PRI's The World.</p>\n<p>Arcos is featured in a 15-part Mexican documentary series called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFjDo4pTcXI\">Los Otros Mexicanos</a>,\" which shows average Mexican immigrants who have made a big impact on American society.</p>\n<p>\"When they first approached me about it, I kind of just sort of laughed,\" says the 52-year-old. \"I've always been the one always asking the questions ... [but] they said they really liked the aspect about music and how I'm in the position of being a 'tastemaker,' influencing the taste of Americans.\"</p>\n<p>Arcos just curated a music festival in Los Angeles that showcased four bands playing cumbia, a popular Afro-Latino style. \"I think cumbia is the hippest music on the planet,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"He's very involved in taking the roots of lots of Mexican music and letting the United States know and learn about the music, so I thought it would be a great show to use Betto,\" says Carlos Gonzalez Sarinana, the series' director.</p>\n<p>Arcos is originally from Xalapa, the state capital of Veracruz. He's lived in Los Angeles since 1995, where he works as independent radio producer and hosts a music show called \"Global Village\" on station KPFK.</p>\n<p>He's proud of the way he was portrayed in the documentary. \"I like to wear tropical shirts from Mexico and a hat ... I'm just myself,\" Arcos says. \"I don't like to put on a role. It's just Betto in action.\" ​The series also focuses on an events producer in New York, a playwright in northern California, a food vendor in Chicago, a doctor in San Diego and an activist in Phoenix.</p>\n<p>Arcos also enjoys how those stories find a middle ground between the standard portrayals of Mexican immigrants. \"There is a sense that you’re either an undocumented worker who toils in the fields — which there's nothing wrong with that, as I come from humble origins, too — or you're ... the big director who wins an Oscar,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"But the truth is there's a lot of room in between those two stereotypes. There are a lot of people who come to this country who have an education who contribute positively to the enrichment of the US — and I'm just one of them, among hundreds, thousands, if not millions.\"</p>\n<p><em>\"Los Otros Mexicanos\" premieres on March 5 on Mexico's <a href=\"http://www.canalonce.mx/\">Canal 11</a>.</em></p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-03-04%2Fworlds-latin-music-reporter-features-film-successful-immigrants&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/story/images/Los%20Otros%20Mexicanos_CROP.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/los-otros-mexicanoscropjpg"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0305201502.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0305201502mp3"}]}
