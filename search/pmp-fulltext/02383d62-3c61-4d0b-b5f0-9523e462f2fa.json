For 29-year-old <strong>Sarah Outen</strong>, the journey has lasted nearly four years. But it was hardly a direct route! Outen has so far traveled 22,000 miles on a self-propelled round-the-world voyage.</p><p>The trip has included 11,000 miles of biking and kayaking across Europe and Asia; 150 days alone at sea, rowing between Japan and Alaska; 1,500 miles in her kayak through the treacherous Aleutian islands; followed by 5,000 miles across the United States and Canada by bike.</p><p>In addition to the sheer challenge of the trip &#8211; which she named &#8220;London2London: Via the World&#8221; (L2L) &#8211; Outen is traveling to raise money for four charities: <a href=\"http://coppafeel.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Coppafeel</a>, which raises awareness and funds for breast cancer; the <a href=\"http://www.mndassociation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MND Association</a> for research into motor neurone disease; <a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org/us\" target=\"_blank\">Wateraid</a>, an international organization promoting clean drinking water and the <a href=\"http://jst.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Jubilee Sailing Trust</a>.</p><p>Now, Sarah Outen is preparing for her last 3,000 mile solo rowing trip across the Atlantic, to end up in London, where she began her trip in 2011.
