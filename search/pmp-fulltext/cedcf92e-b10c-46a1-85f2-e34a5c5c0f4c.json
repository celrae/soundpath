Experts debate income inequality for <em>Intelligence Squared U.S.</em>","itags":["npr_api","359363643"],"guid":"cedcf92e-b10c-46a1-85f2-e34a5c5c0f4c","contentencoded":"<p>Income inequality has been on the rise in the U.S. for decades. The top 1 percent of earners in the U.S. now holds a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/02/349863761/40-years-of-income-inequality-in-america-in-graphs\">much greater share of national income</a> than three decades ago. At the same time, incomes for the bottom half of American households have remained virtually flat.</p><p>Some economists and social scientists argue that income inequality leads to unequal access to opportunity and resources like nutrition and education. That's left children born to poor families with little hope of escaping poverty themselves, they argue, and has made upward mobility unattainable for many in the middle class, as well.</p><p>But others say that income inequality is not inherently a bad thing. They point to research that finds that countries with greater inequality also experience more economic growth. That means that people at all income levels will benefit, they argue, even if their individual slice of the economic pie becomes smaller.</p><p>At the <a href=\"http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/1159-income-inequality-impairs-the-american-dream\" target=\"_blank\">latest <em>Intelligence Squared U.S.</em> event</a>, two teams addressed these questions to debate the motion, \"Income Inequality Impairs The American Dream of Upward Mobility.\"</p><p>Before the debate, the audience at the Kaufman Music Center in New York was 60 percent in favor of the motion and 14 percent against, with 26 percent undecided. After the debate, 53 percent favored the motion and 37 percent voted against it, making the team arguing against the motion the winner of this particular debate.</p><p>Those debating:</p><p><strong>FOR THE MOTION</strong></p><p><strong>Elise Gould</strong> is the senior economist and director of health policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, where she researches wages, poverty, inequality, economic mobility and health care.
