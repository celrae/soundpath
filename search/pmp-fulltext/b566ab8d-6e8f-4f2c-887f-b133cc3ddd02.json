Paying credit card interest tends to be expensive.

There's a reason card company's offer these rewards systems.</p>\n<p>\"The more you spend in pursuit of these rewards, the more likely you are to get in debt,\" says Lieber. \"Once you're in debt, you'll be paying 12 or 18 or 20 percent a year and then the credit card companies win.\"</p>\n<p>And even for those people who never carry a debt, Lieber says \"the card companies are hoping that they will spend more than they might have otherwise, because it's a credit card, because they don't have to pay it off for 30 to 40 days, and because they get these points and they think, 'well, you know, at least I'm getting the miles if I'm going on this shopping spree.'\"</p>\n<p>But that's exactly what the card companies want you think, warns Lieber: \"The object of the game is to be as unprofitable of a customer as you possibly can, to never carry a balance, but to get all of the rewards for spending you would otherwise do but not spend more than you necessarily should, just in pursuit of those miles.\"</p></div>","tags":["APM","Credit Cards","Your Money","financial advice"],"byline":"Adrienne Hill","teaser":"Advice on how to take advantage of credit card offers without letting credit companies take advantage of you.","itags":["Marketplace Money for Friday, August 2, 2013","Marketplace","Marketplace Money","PMP:Marketplace_PMP","b566ab8d6e8ff2cc87fbb133cc3ddd02"],"guid":"b566ab8d-6e8f-4f2c-887f-b133cc3ddd02","description":"Advice on how to take advantage of credit card offers without letting credit companies take advantage of you.","contenttemplated":"[{\"type\":\"text/html\",\"content\":\"<p>Next time you&apos;re shopping for a new credit card, check your mailbox.
