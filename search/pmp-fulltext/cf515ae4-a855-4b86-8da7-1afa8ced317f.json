But the demos included in the expanded edition provide a rare glimpse into Jackson's creative process.","itags":["npr_api","312156512"],"guid":"cf515ae4-a855-4b86-8da7-1afa8ced317f","contentencoded":"<p>When he died in June 2009, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/16782748/michael-jackson\">Michael Jackson</a> left behind a trove of unfinished recordings — some were released on the 2010 album <em>Michael</em>, while many more were left behind because they were in rough demo form. Jackson's label went through the material, then asked <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15623012/timbaland\">Timbaland</a> and other top producers to finish the King of Pop's ideas with an album called <em>Xscape</em>.</p><p>When it comes to posthumous releases by major stars, the music business doesn't exactly have a stellar track record. Think about the contrived duets between <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15396919/natalie-cole\">Natalie Cole</a> and her departed dad, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15392890/nat-king-cole\">Nat King Cole</a>. So I approached this new collection of unreleased Michael Jackson material with caution.</p><p>There's still no mistaking that voice; that fervent intensity he brought to every line. Can't lie: It's nice to hear. Still, there's reason to wince about this project — it's devoted to material that Jackson worked on for various albums, but didn't finish or elected not to share. Making matters worse, these tracks don't represent Jackson's vision alone: Label president L.A. Reid commissioned producers to \"contemporize\" — his word — Jackson's demos to appeal to the current market.</p><p>But the deluxe version also includes the raw demos before they were \"contemporized.\" Even in what sounds like a rehearsal situation, Jackson manages to convey the heart of a song. He nails all the twists of the melody. His passion sells it — you forget it's not a final take. At times, he sounds like he's thinking back to Motown days and recalling the influence of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15184517/stevie-wonder\">Stevie Wonder</a>.</p><p>The set tells us something else about Michael Jackson: He struggled to escape the long shadow of <em>Thriller</em>. On his subsequent records, songs that sounded too similar to his hits didn't make the cut. Several of these appear on the new <em>Xscape</em>. These are not earth-shattering compositions, but they're solid and exhilarating in spots — certainly more than just vault scraps. You can hear Jackson really pouring energy into them, doing his best to lift them up. It's the performances that make this a worthwhile, valuable, fitting postscript to Jackson's legacy.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
