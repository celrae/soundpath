He says &#8220;the bill has nothing to do with the environment,&#8221; and that it&#8217;s a threat to manufacturing jobs in California and the industry as a whole.</p><p>Plastic bags, Berrier says, make up less than 0.5 percent of the American waste stream, according to the EPA. He adds that if people are &#8220;responsibly using, reusing and recycling these products, they&#8217;re actually highly environmentally friendly,&#8221; and more energy efficient than paper bags to produce and recycle.</p><p>But according to<strong> Molly Peterson</strong>, environment correspondent with <a href=\"http://www.scpr.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Southern California Public Radio</a>, &#8220;Environmentalists say it&#8217;s less about the amount in the total waste stream and more about the insidiousness and the persistence of that plastic.&#8221;</p><p>Further, Peterson says that even if the ban is suspended, around one third of Californians live in areas with a local plastic bag ban.</p><p>The same environmental groups that support the state-wide ban, she adds, are concentrating their efforts on a local level, working to add to the &#8220;130 municipalities, counties, and local entities that have enacted some sort of a ban.&#8221;</p><p>Anti-plastic bag sentiment, Peterson says, is &#8220;a pretty widespread thing at this point.&#8221;</p><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><strong>Jon Berrier</strong>, of the <a href=\"http://plasticsindustry.org/apba/\" target=\"_blank\">American Progressive Bag Alliance</a>.</li><li><strong>Molly Peterson</strong>, environment correspondent with Southern California Public Radio</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
