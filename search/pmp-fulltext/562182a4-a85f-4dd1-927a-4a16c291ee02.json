He's also not alone. The quirky popularity of attractive economists in Argentina belies the country's real, everyday problems with inflation.","contentencoded":"<p>We all have our secret celebrity crushes: a movie star, a pop star, maybe even a sexy writer or two (hello, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/03/benjamin-kunkel-marxist-novel-utopia-or-bust.html\">Benjamin Kunkel</a>!). But in Argentina, some of the people with big Twitter followings and legions of autograph-seekers are ... economists. Really.</p>\n<p>Yep! Though, of course, \"the most popular Argentine economists are the ones that combine being famous and being handsome,” says Veronica Smink, a reporter for the BBC based in Buenos Aires. The Economist recently published an article about <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21635016-tango-fame-argentine-economists-tinged-sadness-sages\">the minor celebrity</a> status enjoyed by of these number-crunchers.</p>\n<p>Martín Lousteau, the former minister of economy and production, is one such economic hottie — though it doesn't hurt that he’s married to a famous Argentine actress. “He is not only well respected as an economist, but people look into the magazines to look into his personal life,” Smink says.</p>\n<p>Economists Martín Redrado and Alfonso Prat-Gay might also make the list of economic superstars. And then there's Axel Kicillof, Argentina's current finance minister, who even has <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/the-internet-is-obsessed-with-argentinas-good-looking-econom\">a pack of global groupies</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\"><p>Ministro de economía \"hot\".
