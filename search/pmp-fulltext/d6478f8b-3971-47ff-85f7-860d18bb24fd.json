He estimates that 1 million Nepalese children are in need of help, including assistance coping with shock. He tells <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young that families are sleeping under tarps in the cold and rainy weather.</p><h4>Interview Highlights</h4><p><strong>On the trauma facing people</strong></p><p>&#8220;Although the original earthquake was terrifying and lasted almost a minute long, I mean, living through that myself was a hard thing, but now these small two second-shakes, three-second shakes, they shake people up.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On what the aftershocks have been like</strong></p><p>&#8220;Last night, while we were sleeping in the rain and the cold, between probably 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., we experienced three of those, and I know because I&#8217;m sleeping here with many families, and the kids wake up. The dogs start to bark, the kids start to cry and I hear their mothers consoling them. That&#8217;s the sounds that we&#8217;re hearing &#8230; It&#8217;s very traumatizing.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the mounting tension in the days after the quake</strong></p><p>&#8220;I hear both sides. I&#8217;ve heard great stories of neighborhood associations banding together, going through rubble, finding survivors in their own neighborhood. This is a hand-by-brick operation &#8212; they are uncovering people on their own, with their hands. But you know, as the days go on, tension is rising. I think because you live in fear, and I think people are also fearful around the supplies of food and water.&#8221;</p><h4>How You Can Help</h4><p><em>The following organizations are on the ground in Nepal and offer instructions on their sites with how you can help.</em></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.supportunicef.org/site/c.dvKUI9OWInJ6H/b.7549291/k.BDF0/Home.htm\" target=\"_blank\">UNICEF</a></li><li><a href=\"https://give.wfp.org/5279/?step=country&lead%C3%83%C2%A2%C3%82%C2%80%C3%82%C2%94source=2015-wfp-nepal-emergency&form%C3%83%C2%A2%C3%82%C2%80%C3%82%C2%94tag=2015-wfp-nepal-emergency\" target=\"_blank\">U.N.
