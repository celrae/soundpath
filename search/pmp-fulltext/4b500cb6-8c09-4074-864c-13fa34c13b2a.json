American travel agencies say they are planning more trips to the Islamic Republic. Officials in Iran say they are issuing more tourism visas, and spending by foreign visitors is up.</p><p>Of course, that's not Iran's reputation. With neighbors Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, the U.S. State Department says American visitors should be aware of the risks.</p><p>And indeed, Iran's border areas can be very dangerous. But Kahmin Mohammadi, an Iranian-born journalist and travel writer, says if you stay away from those regions, you'll find a warm welcome.</p><p>Most Western visitors travel to Iran on a tour, which typically starts in Tehran. But beyond the capital city, she recommends the city of Esfahan, with some of the most exquisite mosques in the world.</p><p>\"You can't go wrong with Esfahan,\" Mohammadi tells NPR's Ari Shapiro. \"We have a medieval mosque, for example, called Monar Jonban, which has two minarets,\" she says.</p><p>Monar Jonban means \"shaking minarets.\" If you climb up in one minaret, wedge your legs against one end and wiggle, it moves with you. It has for centuries.</p><p>Mohammadi also recommends Esfahan for what she calls \"the quintessential Persian experience\": tea at the Abbasi Hotel. \"Lounge back against Persian carpet-covered cushions ... with the fountain tinkling and a nightingale singing\" to really soak in the culture, she says.</p><p>Another must-see is Shiraz, outside Persepolis, the 6th century B.C. palace and capital of the ancient Persian kings.</p><p>\"One of our great Persian kings, Darius, is actually mentioned in the bible for freeing the Jews from slavery ... in fact, the [ancient] Persian empire was known for being very tolerant,\" Mohammadi says. \"That's something ... that we tend not to know about Iran, how much religious tolerance there is.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
