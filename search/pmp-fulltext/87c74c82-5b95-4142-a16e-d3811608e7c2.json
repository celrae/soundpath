They have this dream that everyone will be always connected to the Internet, and potentially even to each other. So you can take it a step further, and what if your chip were connected to someone else&#8217;s chip, and you could kind of get a collective brain power. And on the one hand, you can see why someone would want a chip in their brain. It&#8217;s like instant memory, instant Internet, you have all of this information at your disposal. On the other hand, it&#8217;s the same as with all these technologies. If we&#8217;re having privacy concerns about the NSA checking on our phones and our emails, imagine what happens when we now have brain chips in our head, and the government, medical institutions, whoever it is, has access to that data.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;You can see why someone would want a chip in their brain. It&#8217;s like instant memory, instant Internet, you have all of this information at your disposal.&#8221;</p><p></div></p><p><strong>The future of gene manipulation</strong></p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s now for the first time a technology that&#8217;s being developed at Harvard and MIT that can take one single gene and change it before someone is even born, at least in theory that&#8217;s what we can do. And people are thinking, &#8216;Oh, well why can&#8217;t we just do this to create super people? Why can&#8217;t I have a designer baby?&#8217; And it I think that is a long way off, because intelligence is incredibly complicated, and there&#8217;s no such thing a smart gene. There&#8217;s lots of genes that interact with each other, and they have a different function at different points in our development, so that&#8217;s a very distant possibility. But we&#8217;re going to have to figure out a lot more before we can do that.&#8221;</p><p><strong>The ethics of brain enhancement</strong></p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a question of health, because we don&#8217;t actually know what will happen to us in the long term if we do manage to rev our brains up. Our brains have been enhanced over millennia. And so what if they&#8217;re already running as they should be? And if we make them try to run more efficiently, faster, become better at something, what is the long-term effect? Are we going to die sooner? Are we going to get dementia sooner? All of these health questions, we haven&#8217;t answered those yet.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.mariakonnikova.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maria Konnikova</a></strong>, author and contributor at The New Yorker.
