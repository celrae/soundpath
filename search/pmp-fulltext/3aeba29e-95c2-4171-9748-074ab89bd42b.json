Some 40 years later, he's still doing things his own way. Now, at age 83, he's taking on 3-D in a new film called <em>Goodbye to Language,</em> which shared the Jury Prize at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.</p><p>There are elements of<em> Goodbye to Language </em>you might find in any Hollywood movie — people arguing, a shootout — and even a dog, the director's own. (Roxy wanders the countryside conversing with the lake and the river that want to tell him what humans never hear.)</p><p>There are also signature Godard touches: There are quotes from philosophers, artists, novelists — as part of the dialogue or recited by a narrator. There's music where you least expect it, and not where you do. And there's a story that's hasn't been neatly stitched together.</p><p>Underlying it all, there's Godard's unusual approach to 3-D.</p><p>Godard generally avoids interviews, but he did talk for Canon Cameras about what attracted him to 3-D in the first place. \"There aren't any rules,\" he said. \"It is still a place where there are no rules.\"</p><p>3-D uses two cameras to make an image appear to have depth, but <em>Goodbye to Language </em>goes beyond that, explains film historian and critic David Bordwell.</p><p>\"Normally they're interlocked to produce a smooth image, a 3-D illusion,\" Bordwell explains. \"But what Godard does in a couple of points in the film is pan one of the two cameras he uses but keep the other one fixed on the object. So in fact you get a splitting of the image — two flat images, superimposed on each other in depth. When [the] first instance of that showed up in the film at Cannes, audiences spontaneously applauded. They had never seen anything like it.\"</p><p>Godard's unconventional technique isn't just for the sake of rule-breaking, Bordwell insists.</p><p>\"It's very startling but kind of poetic effect, particularly in the context of a scene where people are separating from each other,\" Bordwell says.</p><p>Bordwell likens Godard to a modern painter, and so does Heloise Godet, one of the film's stars. She recalls asking the filmmaker about her character, a woman in an unhappy relationship. In response, Godard showed her a picture of a piece of modern art. \"It was really abstract,\" she recalls. Godard said, \"OK, that's your character.\" She remembers the conversation was \"weird but really inspiring.\"</p><p>\"Weird but inspiring\" might describe how even Godard's producers see his projects. Vincent Maraval pursued a profession in film at age 14 after seeing a Godard movie. He still finds Godard's work strangely puzzling and compelling. Maraval says the 83-year-old filmmaker has the attitude of a young innovator.</p><p>\"For every project, he's looking for the unknown,\" Maraval says. \"He looks for an experience. He doesn't know where he goes, and that's what motivates him. That's what I call being very young. ... He's always very ready for adventure.\"</p><p>Godard himself steps into his film — at least through his voice as an unseen teacher expounding on watercolor painting. \"That's what Kirillov says in Dostoyevsky's novel: two questions, a big one and a little one,\" the audience hears Godard say. \"But the little one is also big. What's difficult is to fit flatness into depth. [The little one?] Suffering. [The big one?] The other world.\"</p><p>And this may be just what <em>Goodbye to Language </em>is about, says Bordwell.</p><p>\"I think what he's talking about — and this is one of the reasons the dog Roxy is very prominent in the film — is that he's trying to get people to look at the world in a kind of an unspoiled way,\" says Bordwell. \"There are hints throughout the film that animal consciousness is kind of closer to the world than we are, that language sets up a barrier or filter or screen between us and what's really there. And although the film is full of language, talk, printed text and so on, nevertheless I think there's a sense he wants the viewer to scrape away a lot of the ordinary conceptions we have about how we communicate and look at the world afresh.\"</p><p>To make us see is one of the oldest goals of movies, one that has pushed Godard to keep working for more than half a century. He's already at work on his next film.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
