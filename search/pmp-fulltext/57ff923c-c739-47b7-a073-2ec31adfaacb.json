There are references to &#8220;Shoppers of the World Unite&#8221; and &#8220;Occupy Mall Street.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I love the way Madison Avenue always is good at taking political movements and things that have some kind of important political statement and turning them into ways to sell better toilet paper and dog food,&#8221; Gilliam said.&#8221;When we were preparing it and even when we were shooting it, I kept adding thing thinking this was about the near future. But by the time we finished, it was a period piece. Things are moving so rapidly now, you can&#8217;t keep up with the change.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rae7_O_6EtU\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://terrygilliamweb.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Terry Gilliam</strong></a>, director of the new film, &#8220;The Zero Theorem.&#8221; He tweets @TerryGilliam.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 WBUR-FM.
