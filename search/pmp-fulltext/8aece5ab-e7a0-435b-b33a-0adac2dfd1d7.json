Neither did the famous photographer Michael Jang. Then he realized the photos he took as a college student gave a rare glimpse of a Chinese American family growing up in the heyday of The Brady Bunch.","contentencoded":"<p>Michael Jang has long been a top-flight commercial photographer, shooting stars like Robin Williams and Jimi Hendrix. But his latest exhibition is a family photo album, with a cultural &mdash; and historical &mdash; twist.</p><p>&quot;<a href=\"http://www.michaeljang.com/portfolio/photos_the_jangs.html\">The Jangs&quot;&nbsp;</a>is a story of American assimilation, but it&rsquo;s not the story you&rsquo;re used to hearing about Chinese Americans. Because Michael Jang&rsquo;s cousins aren&rsquo;t playing &ldquo;the math nerd&rdquo; in an after-school special.</p><p>They&rsquo;re reading Mad Magazine, going record shopping, and walking on stilts in their underwear. Their bedrooms are covered in football posters.

Bad idea.\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]As Jang puts it: &ldquo;In retrospect &hellip; I&rsquo;m pretty sure there isn&rsquo;t anything, a document like this, of Chinese in America in the 70s.&rdquo;</p><p>The series came about almost by accident. In 1973, Jang was in college and signed up for a photography workshop with the legendary <a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=1556\">Lizette Model </a>in San Francisco.</p><p>&ldquo;I stayed with my cousins close by,&rdquo; Jang explains. &ldquo;They let me stay there that summer and I realized what a goldmine they were. So I just started photographing them and bringing that work into class. And they just had a crazy lifestyle.&rdquo;</p><p>Okay, a lot of us have families with a &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; lifestyle, but our photographs still suck. Because it&rsquo;s not just about knowing your f-stops or having the right lens. If you want a family photo album like The Jangs, you have to be tenacious &mdash; and fearless.</p><p>&ldquo;When you kind of photograph your own family, it&rsquo;s very hard,&rdquo; Jang says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get the hand-in-the-face, you know &mdash; just don&rsquo;t do this &mdash; and it just makes you kind of want to quit, but I was persistent and I think I just basically broke them down. Luckily, they were good sports.&rdquo;</p><p>Luckily because, Jang adds, &ldquo;They certainly weren&rsquo;t crazy about the photographs. They weren&rsquo;t necessarily flattering. I tend to go for the jugular when humor is involved.&rdquo;</p><p>Humor is definitely involved. Take, for example, one of the standouts in the series &mdash; a photograph of his aunts and uncles, dancing in hipster sunglasses.</p><p>&ldquo;I had this basket full of sunglasses that were just a collection of fun stuff because I used to do rock and roll and everything,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Everyone chose them and put them on and it just ended up being the last shot of the whole series.&quot;</p><p>&quot;In fact, you can look at it and it wasn&rsquo;t even framed. I actually missed it &mdash; people are kind of off center and they&rsquo;re looking away and the whole group is kind of breaking up. Who woulda thunk it, right, that this is going to be in the Museum of Modern Art someday.&rdquo;</p><p>Who woulda thunk it because, let&rsquo;s face it, the words &ldquo;funny&rdquo; and &ldquo;fine art&rdquo; don&rsquo;t often go together.</p><p>&ldquo;I think a lot of art tends to be serious,&quot; Jang says, &quot;and I recall experiences of going to museums and it almost feeling like walking through a mausoleum. You&rsquo;re not going to hear anyone laughing in there. The humor wasn&rsquo;t intentional, it just is, and that&rsquo;s what may set it apart from a lot of work.&rdquo;</p><p>When I asked&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.michaeljang.com/\">Michael Jang</a>&nbsp;why it took him more than 30 years to show these photos of his own Chinese-American family, he gives a couple of different answers. &ldquo;The story on keeping them under wraps is simply this,&quot; he tells me. &quot;I just did it for fun and it was homework. And I didn&rsquo;t get that much positive feedback at the time from my teachers. I just didn&rsquo;t think it was any big deal.&rdquo;</p><p>But he also says, &ldquo;In the 50s and 60s, being Chinese was a lot different than being Asian in the new millennium. I didn&rsquo;t feel doors were that open. So I kind of didn&rsquo;t have aspirations to be well known as a photographer or an artist.&rdquo;</p><p>And in the same way the contents of a time-capsule gain significance just by being temporarily forgotten, Jang&rsquo;s unappreciated &ldquo;homework&rdquo; feels like a revelation today, especially because Asian Americans rarely even appear in the documentary photography of that era.</p><p>Back when Jang began shooting &quot;The Jangs,&quot; the words &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; and &quot;photographer&quot; didn&rsquo;t often go together.</p><p>&ldquo;On the fame level of, say, Adams &mdash; as in Ansel, or Avedon, as in Richard, or even Arbus, as in Diane &mdash; and I&rsquo;m just in the A&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; he laughs, &quot;what Chinese photographer comes to mind at that level? Most people draw a blank and I&rsquo;m thinking, wow, that&rsquo;s interesting.&rdquo;</p><p>The humor of these photographs, together with the polyester pantsuits and carpeted bathrooms, has a lot of critics calling &quot;The Jangs&quot; the Asian-American Brady Bunch. Look closely and you&rsquo;ll notice the rice cooker on the counter, the Kung-fu movie playing on the TV, a wall calendar from Chong Imports.</p><p>But mostly you&rsquo;ll just find yourself thinking the Jangs are more American than you ... and they probably had more fun.</p>","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/091520147.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/091520147mp3"}]}
