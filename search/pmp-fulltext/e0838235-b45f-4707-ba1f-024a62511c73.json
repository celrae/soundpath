They call it the Open Source Seed Initiative.","itags":["npr_api","303772556"],"guid":"e0838235-b45f-4707-ba1f-024a62511c73","contentencoded":"<p>A group of scientists and food activists is launching a <a href=\"http://www.news.wisc.edu/22748\">campaign</a> Thursday to change the rules that govern seeds. They're releasing 29 new varieties of crops under a new \"open source pledge\" that's intended to safeguard the ability of farmers, gardeners and plant breeders to share those seeds freely.</p><p>It's inspired by the example of open source software, which is freely available for anyone to use but cannot legally be converted into anyone's proprietary product.</p><p>At an event on the campus of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, backers of the new Open Source Seed Initiative will pass out 29 new varieties of 14 different crops, including carrots, kale, broccoli and quinoa. Anyone receiving the seeds must pledge not to restrict their use by means of patents, licenses or any other kind of intellectual property. In fact, any future plant that's derived from these open source seeds also has to remain freely available as well.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nutrisci.wisc.edu/facultypages/f_goldman.html\">Irwin Goldman</a>, a vegetable breeder at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, helped organize the campaign. It's an attempt to restore the practice of open sharing that was the rule among plant breeders when he entered the profession more than 20 years ago.</p><p>\"If other breeders asked for our materials, we would send them a packet of seed, and they would do the same for us,\" he says. \"That was a wonderful way to work, and that way of working is no longer with us.\"</p><p>These days, seeds are intellectual property. Some are patented as inventions. You need permission from the patent holder to use them, and you're not supposed to harvest seeds for replanting the next year.</p><p>Even university breeders operate under these rules. When Goldman creates a new variety of onions, carrots or table beets, a technology-transfer arm of the university licenses it to seed companies.</p><p>This brings in money that helps pay for Goldman's work, but he still doesn't like the consequences of restricting access to plant genes — what he calls germplasm. \"If we don't share germplasm and freely exchange it, then we will limit our ability to improve the crop,\" he says.</p><p>Sociologist <a href=\"http://www.drs.wisc.edu/faculty/kloppenburg/index.php\">Jack Kloppenburg</a>, also at the University of Wisconsin, has been campaigning against seed patents for 30 years. His reasons go beyond <br />Goldman's.</p><p>He says turning seeds into private property has contributed to the rise of big seed companies that in turn promote ever-bigger, more specialized farms. \"The problem is concentration, and the narrow set of uses to which the technology and the breeding are being put,\" he says.</p><p>Kloppenburg says one important goal for this initiative is simply to get people thinking and talking about how seeds are controlled. \"It's to open people's minds,\" he says. \"It's kind of a biological meme, you might say: Free seed! Seed that can be used by anyone!\"</p><p>The practical impact of the Open Source Seed Initiative on farmers and gardeners, however, may be limited. Even though anyone can use such seed, most people probably won't be able to find it.</p><p>The companies that dominate the seed business probably will keep selling their own proprietary varieties or hybrids. There's more money to be made with those seeds.</p><p>Most commercial vegetable seeds are hybrids, which come with a kind of built-in security lock; if you replant seed from a hybrid, you won't get exactly the same kind of plant. (For this reason, some seed companies don't bother getting patents on their hybrids.)</p><p><a href=\"http://www.amseed.org/american-seed-trade-association-elects-john-schoenecker-to-leadership-role/\">John Shoenecker</a>, director of intellectual property for the seed company HM Clause and the incoming president of the American Seed Trade Association, says his company may avoid using open source seed to breed new commercial varieties \"because then we'd ... have limited potential to recoup the investment.\" That's because the offspring of open source seeds would have to be shared as well, and any other seed company could immediately sell the same variety.</p><p>The initiative is probably more significant for plant breeders, especially at universities. Goldman says he expects many plant breeders at universities to join the open source effort.</p><p>Meanwhile, two small seed companies that specialize in selling to organic farmers — <a href=\"http://www.highmowingseeds.com/\">High Mowing Organic Seeds</a> in Hardwick, Vt., and <a href=\"http://www.wildgardenseed.com/\">Wild Garden Seed</a> in Philomath, Ore., are adding some open source seeds to their catalogs this year.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
