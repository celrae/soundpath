Memories of a music consumer","contentencoded":"<div class=\"barn-cleaned\"><p><span>My first buyer rewards program was at</span> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle's_Records_%26_Tapes\">Turtle’s Records &amp; Tapes</a><span>, a small chain of music stores with a handful of locations in Atlanta. I was 8 years old.</span><br />\n<br /></p>\n<center><script type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"http://static.polldaddy.com/p/7860958.js\">\n</script> <noscript><a href=\"http://polldaddy.com/poll/7860958/\">Do you still pay for music?</a></noscript></center>\n<br />\nIt was the 1980s, so I can’t imagine what kind of information they could have collected from me to validate my “membership.” All I remember was being handed a <a href=\"http://img593.imageshack.us/i/turtlesrecordsstampsboo.png/\">pale yellow pamphlet with squares</a> <span>that you were supposed to cover with stamps – like actual stamps you had to lick to apply – every time you bought a piece of music at Turtle’s.&nbsp; Once you had a certain number of stamps, you received a major discount on a record or cassette, making you more awesome than everyone else in the entire world for a brief moment in time.</span>\n<p><br />\n<br /></p>\n<p><span>I bought a lot of music in my youth. Some of my earliest purchases were the vinyl single of Madonna’s “Like a Prayer” and DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince's iconic album, “He’s the DJ, I’m the Rapper.”</span><br />\n<br />\nMy music access only increased as I got older. In college, I worked part-time at WHOV, the campus radio station where I also DJed a couple of shifts – everything from R&amp;B to straightforward jazz. That meant a little extra spending change ... and more knowledge about music than I ever thought I would need.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2001, when my entire CD collection was stolen from my by a very bad person, I thought I’d never be able to rebuild. But, I was determined. So I kept collecting, this time opting for mostly-used CDs via sites like half.com. A few years later, digital music came on the scene, which made it easier than ever to organize my collection, create mood-setting playlists and buy everything I liked.<br />\n<br />\n<span>But something happened to my music buying habits recently. Free streaming services like Pandora and Spotify came along and my phone got smarter, too – or at least better at gaming the system for free downloads. I just stopped buying music with any regularity. I can’t even remember what year it was when I last updated my iTunes library, and it looks like I’m not alone. Earlier this year, Billboard reported the first drop in digital music sales since the iTunes store made its debut in 2003.&nbsp; CD sales continued their steady decline and overall album sales also experienced an 8.4% drop. All of this made me wonder: Is owning music important to anyone anymore? If yes, then who?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nMarketplace Money took to social media to ask people to tell us why they still buy music – or &nbsp;why they stopped buying – and to share some of their favorite memories as paying music consumers.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nWe kicked off the conversation on Facebook:<br /></p>\n<div id=\"fb-root\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n//<![CDATA[\n(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\n//]]>\n</script>\n<div class=\"fb-post\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/apmmarketplace/posts/10152279953800148:0\" data-width=\"466\">\n<div class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/apmmarketplace/posts/10152279953800148:0\">Post</a> by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/apmmarketplace\">APM: Marketplace</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p><br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>And on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/livemoney\">Twitter</a>,<br />\n<br /></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveMoney\">@LiveMoney</a> Used to be very important when I had to go to an actual store and buy music, not so much any more.</p>\n— Daryl Paranada (@darylparanada) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darylparanada/statuses/440575476017287169\">March 3, 2014</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n</script>\n<p><br />\n<br /></p>\n<p>And, for fun, we asked:<br />\n<br /></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveMoney\">@LiveMoney</a> 1.) first CD i bought was Ricky Martin. 2.)
