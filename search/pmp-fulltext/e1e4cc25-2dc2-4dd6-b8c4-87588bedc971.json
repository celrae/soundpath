Those panelists said they wanted to see more data about whether the drug ultimately reduces heart problems, before it is used more broadly.</p><p>&#8220;I personally fall on the side of having optimism, but I need to see the cardiovascular outcome study to know,&#8221; said Dr. Philip Sanger of Stanford University, who voted for the drug.</p><p>If the FDA follows the group&#8217;s recommendation, the drug could be approved for a much smaller population than its developers have proposed.</p><p>Praluent is part of a new class of injectable drugs that lower cholesterol more than older medications called statins, which have been the standard treatment for more than 20 years. A similar drug from Amgen will go before the same panel on Wednesday.</p><p>Both drugs block a substance called PCSK9, which interferes with the liver&#8217;s ability to remove cholesterol from the blood. Analysts expect the drugs to grow into blockbuster sellers, generating billions of dollars in new sales. But Tuesday&#8217;s meeting underscores the uncertainty about who should receive such medications.</p><p>More than 73 million U.S. adults, or nearly one-third, have high LDL cholesterol, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those patients have twice the risk of heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://faculty.georgetown.edu/dg298/\" target=\"_blank\">David Gortler</a></strong>, professor of pharmacology at Georgetown University and Yale.
