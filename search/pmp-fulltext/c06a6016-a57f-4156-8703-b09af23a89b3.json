At this point, Rebecca is still unsure about what she would major in.

One point that came up during the discussion: going to school locally to save on money.\n<p><span>\"I'm not sure that that is something that I would want to do, to stay so close to home when there are so many places that I could go,\" says Rebecca. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Catherine says in hindsight she wishes Sarah had gone to a local school first, instead of spending four years at Tulane.
