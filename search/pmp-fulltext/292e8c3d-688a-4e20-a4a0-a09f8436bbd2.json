For the 24-year-old singer-songwriter, <em>1989</em> completes her transformation from country stardom to pop stardom; it's full of massively radio-friendly, synth-driven songs that are virtually guaranteed chart-topping ubiquity in the months and years to come.</p><p>But how's the music? I recently pulled my NPR Music colleague and desk-neighbor, editor and writer Jacob Ganz, into the studio for a Small Batch edition of <em>Pop Culture Happy Hour</em> to discuss the record. Spoiler alert: We like <em>1989</em> quite a bit, and are intrigued by its sound, its lyrics and its place in Swift's catalog.
