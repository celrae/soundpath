Though people can't catch it, the malignancy might offer clues to how cancer cells spread in the human body.","itags":["npr_api","398817089"],"guid":"7bf0b13c-6bfa-45af-aeb4-84cddf6a8da8","contentencoded":"<p>Not every clam is, as the expression goes, happy as a clam. Even shellfish, it turns out, can get cancer. And it just might be that this cancer is spread from clam to clam by rogue cells bobbing through the ocean, scientists <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(15)00243-3\">reported</a> Thursday in the journal <em>Cell</em>.</p><p>You might be surprised to hear that clams can get blood cancer. \"But the fact is they have a circulatory system, and they can get leukemia,\" says <a href=\"http://www.hhmi.org/scientists/stephen-p-goff\">Stephen Goff</a>, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Columbia University.</p><p>The leukemia kills the clams, but Goff says it poses no risk to people who eat clams, like the soft-shell clams that are harvested along the Eastern Seaboard. \"I love them,\" he says. \"They're what you get as fried clams and steamers.\"</p><p>But Goff's relationship with clams has just changed dramatically. He usually studies viruses that cause cancer in mice. Recently he was contacted by <a href=\"http://hermes.mbl.edu/publications/labnotes/2005/05_spring03.html\">Carol Reinisch</a>, a biologist at the Marine Biology Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. She studies leukemia in <a href=\"http://www.chesapeakebay.net/fieldguide/critter/soft_shell_clam\">soft-shell clams</a>, and she asked Goff to look for signs of a cancer-causing virus in these clams.</p><p>He didn't find a virus, but what he found instead was a shock. Each of the cancer cells he looked at, in clams from New York to Prince Edward Island, Canada, had a similar genetic fingerprint. That strongly suggests the cancer is spread when these cells replicate<strong> </strong>and spread through the water, he says.</p><p>\"We know the cells can survive in seawater quite long,\" Goff says. \"And we can only guess that they would be picked up somehow by another healthy clam.\"</p><p>This could be because clams feed by filtering enormous volumes of seawater. They might simply siphon up these free-floating cancer cells and literally catch cancer.</p><p>There are only two other cancers known to spread by cells, like this. One is devastating populations of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88131574\">Tasmanian devils</a>, meat-eating marsupials in Australia. Another is <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/01/23/265236618/contagious-cancer-in-dogs-leaves-prehistoric-paw-prints\">spread sexually in dogs</a>. Goff thinks this might be the third example.</p><p>\"It's very clear that something unusual is going on here,\" says <a href=\"http://mcbs.unh.edu/faculty/lesser\">Michael Lesser</a>, a marine biologist at the University of New Hampshire.</p><p>But he says this isn't an open-and-shut case. Nobody has yet done the critical lab experiment to show that this cell-based transmission actually occurs. He wants firsthand evidence that a clam, by eating a cancer cell, can actually contract the disease.</p><p>Scientists who study these clams are eager to get going on these experiments, Lesser says, to see whether they can prove this transmission is actually happening.</p><p>However this turns out, Goff says, surprises like this can really move science forward.</p><p>\"I'm a big fan of the idea that when something really intriguing comes along, it's great to follow your lead and see where it's going to take you,\" he says.</p><p>This opens up a host of questions about how diseases might spread through the marine environment. And it might have implications for human health as well.</p><p>\"Learning how these cells are evolving, learning how they manage to spread will be very interesting,\" Goff says. \"I think it could inform our understanding of how metastasis occurs.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
