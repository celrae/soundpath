But there has remained one constant â€” our theme music.</p><p>The <em>Morning Edition</em> theme was written by BJ Leiderman in 1979. At the time, he was a struggling college student who wrote jingles on the side. He gave a demo tape of his music to a friend who worked at NPR.</p><p>On that tape was one little musical phrase that eventually became the <em>Morning Edition</em> theme music.</p><p>After it was selected, Leiderman wrote lyrics to accompany his little ditty:</p><p><em>Oh I hate to get up in the morning</em></p><p><em>Please don't wake me up this morning</em></p><p><em>Let me stay in bed ... and ... sleep (I don't like to daydream)</em></p><p><em>The world can turn without me today</em></p><p><em>And if you wake me up I can say</em></p><p><em>That we will not be friends ... for ... long</em></p><p><em>Remember when ... we used to sleep forever?</em></p><p><em>Dreams ... floating as light as feathers</em></p><p><em>When ... will those delightful dreams</em></p><p><em>Come back again?</em></p><p><em>Tell me when!!!</em></p><p><em>For crying out loud, please would you shut up</em></p><p><em>No news, no features, I've had enough ...</em></p><p><em>But, say, who wrote your great ... theme ... song???</em></p><p>Since that time, Leiderman has composed many other public radio classics. He has written themes for <em>Weekend Edition</em>, <em>Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!</em>, <em>Car Talk</em> and <em>Marketplace</em>.</p><p>Next year, he'll release his first album. It's called <em>Natural Public Leiderman</em>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
