Peled had no classical background; his parents were not musicians. He says his own budding interest in the cello was a scam, a way of getting close to a girl in his town who happened to play the instrument. And yet, every night, he would fall asleep with the tape playing from a boombox beside his bed. The music made an impression.</p><p>\"I would call him the grandfather of classical music of the 20th century â€” not just for cellists,\" Peled says. \"He really shaped what we know today of how to make a phrase, and was a bridge from the old times, from romantic music, to our day. He played the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15033230/johannes-brahms\" target=\"_blank\">Brahms</a> Sonata for Brahms. I mean, that link is something that you can't stop thinking about.\"</p><p>Peled's obsession became devotion; today he's an acclaimed cellist himself. Now, he's found another way to follow in his idol's footsteps.</p><p>On Thursday, Feb. 12, Peled will appear at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, where Casals gave a recital 100 years ago this week, to perform the exact same program <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/johnshopkinsu\" target=\"_blank\">in a live webcast</a>. More than that, he'll do it with the same instrument: Casals' 1733 Goffriller cello, presented to him by the late master's widow.</p><p>He joined David Greene in NPR's Washington, D.C., studios to play the instrument and talk about its significance and his own journey to this moment.
