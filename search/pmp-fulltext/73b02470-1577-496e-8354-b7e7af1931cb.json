Not only did it mean finding puffin chicks and transplanting them as hatchlings, but also hand-rearing them, tagging them and then waiting for years for them to grow up at sea and come home to mate and rear their own young. If they came back at all.</p><p>Today, more than 1,000 pairs of puffins populate the five Maine islands around Muscongus Bay. But it took eight years before the first pair came home to mate, and another 30 or so to get the healthy population that lives and nests there today.</p><p>Stephen Kress&#8217;s new book &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Project-Puffin-Improbable-Beloved-Seabird/dp/0300204817\" target=\"_blank\">Project Puffin: The Improbable Quest to Bring a Beloved Seabird Back to Egg Rock</a>&#8221; documents not only the effort to restore the population to Egg Rock, but also the history of the region&#8217;s puffins, and a look forward to their future fate.</p><p>Kress joined <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young, along with photojournalist and co-author <strong>Derrick Jackson</strong>, to discuss &#8220;<a href=\"http://projectpuffin.audubon.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Puffin</a>.&#8221;</p><h4>See More Of Derrick Jackson&#8217;s Photos Of Puffins</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.birds.cornell.edu/allaboutbirds/page.aspx?pid=1090\" target=\"_blank\">Read more about Project Puffin</a></li></ul><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/staff/jackson\" target=\"_blank\">Derrick Z.
