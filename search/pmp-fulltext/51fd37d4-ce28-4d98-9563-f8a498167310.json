So the Kite Patch emits odors that actually block the ability of mosquitoes to detect the carbon dioxide.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;These additional compounds will make the mosquitoes say, &#8216;I thought I saw something, but I don&#8217;t anymore,&#8217; and just turn and go a different way.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the limitations of currently available insect repellents</strong></p><p>&#8220;DEET, as a chemical, blocks some of the neuromuscular transmissions that are necessary and is thought to, in some people at least, cause some type of neuromuscular problems. There are safety challenges, sufficient that both Health Canada and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend limiting use in children. And netting, also, is a physical barrier. It&#8217;s very effective, especially treated nets, but the chemicals wear out and also the mosquitoes become resistant.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://iecrowd.com/member/molly-schmid\" target=\"_blank\">Molly Schmid</a></strong>, scientist and vice president of life and health technologies at <a href=\"http://iecrowd.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ieCrowd</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
