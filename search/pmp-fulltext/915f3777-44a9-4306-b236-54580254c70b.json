Today that number is much lower, and city officials are hoping that tearing down the three-ton sign will help remove some of the city’s bad reputation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The sign is made out of weapons confiscated by the Mexican army and faces the United States, which some see as aggressive. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"675\" width=\"900\" alt=\"The sign is made of pieces of confiscated firearms and weighs three tons.

The city is trying to clean up its image, and attracting tourists is an important step in the process. Ortiz-Uribe says that the area around the sign has even been a development focus for local officials.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"The city has redone the outside of the buildings along the main strip into the downtown,\" she says. \"There are bars, markets and restaurants...It's a great place to start if you want to go back to Juárez.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"675\" width=\"900\" alt=\"The U.S. Embassy in Juárez will retain a piece of the sign that once made up the dot below an exclamation point. \" title=\"The U.S. Embassy in Juárez will retain a piece of the sign that once made up the dot below an exclamation point. \" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/ExclamationPoint.JPG?itok=_v3IXIdH\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>The U.S. Embassy in Juárez will retain a piece of the sign that once made up the dot below an exclamation point. </p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Mónica Ortiz Uribe</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The sign is expected to be completely disassembled in the next few days.</p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-06-18%2Fju-rez-tearing-down-huge-reminder-its-bloody-past&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/story/images/NoMoreWeapons.JPG","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://admin.pri.org/file/nomoreweaponsjpg"},{"href":"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/06182015_09.mp3"},{"href":"http://admin.pri.org/file/0618201509mp3"}]}
