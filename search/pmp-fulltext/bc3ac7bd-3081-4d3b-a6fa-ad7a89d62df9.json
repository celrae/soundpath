So how much exercise do you get from an afternoon on the links? Players clipped on pedometers and Fitbits to help us find out.","itags":["npr_api","413683367"],"guid":"bc3ac7bd-3081-4d3b-a6fa-ad7a89d62df9","contentencoded":"<p>When we asked adults who play sports which one they play the most, golf topped the list. That's right: <a href=\"http://media.npr.org/documents/2015/june/sportsandhealthpoll.pdf\">Our poll</a> finds that a day on the links beat out soccer, softball and tennis.</p><p>My first reaction was: <em>Whaaat?</em> Golf is played by people riding around in motorized carts; how much exercise could you possibly get?</p><p>So, with a fair amount of skepticism, I ventured out to <a href=\"https://www.mcggolf.com/Courses/SligoCreek.aspx\">Sligo Creek Golf Course</a>, a municipal course in Silver Spring, Md., to try to answer this question.</p><p>The first golfer I met came striding off the 9th hole, pushing her clubs with a pushcart. Sweat covered her brow. \"No cart?\" I asked.</p><p>Nope, Kelly James told me. \"I've gotten well over 10,000 steps playing golf,\" she said. And that's not all. The game's full of athletic moves.</p><p>\"You're swinging — big swings — to drive the ball,\" James says. That uses lots of muscles. \"There's even a little yoga,\" she says, if you consider the balancing, and the turning and twisting of the torso — and the overall meditative aspect of being on the course.</p><p><em>Hmm</em>, I thought. Maybe I'd underestimated the game.</p><p>The World Golf Foundation estimates that golfers who walk an 18-hole course clock <a href=\"http://wearegolf.org/fitness-benefits/overview/\">about 5 miles</a> and burn <a href=\"http://www.golf2020.com/research/health-wellness.aspx\">up to 2,000 calories</a>.</p><p>But here's the rub: About two-thirds of golf in the U.S. is played in motorized carts. Some resorts and private courses even restrict walking and <em>require </em>carts.</p><p>Why is the cart culture so dominant? There are lots of reasons, according to <a href=\"http://www.worldgolffoundation.org/about-wgf/bio-steve-mona/\">Steve Mona</a>, CEO of the World Golf Foundation. For example, carts are a source of revenue for golf clubs. They enable golf facilities \"to get more people on the course and get them around the course faster,\" Mona says.</p><p>Another reason: Carts can help older people and others unable to walk long distances keep playing the game.</p><p>\"I started playing when I was 9 years old,\" golfer Gary Metzger told me. And over his lifetime, he says, he's played a lot of sports. But after two hip replacement surgeries and operations on his knees, \"it's one of the few things I can still do.\" What Metzger loves about the game, he says, is that \"it's the one sport you can plan to play the rest of your life.\"</p><p>I clipped a pedometer on Gary's golf partner, his wife, Karen, to see how many steps she'd get during a round of golf using a cart.</p><p>She surprised me, clocking 2,880 steps — more than a mile — during nine holes. \"Wow, that's great,\" Karen said, when she saw the number.</p><p>Mona says that the distance she covered is pretty typical. The distance can vary — better golfers, with more accurate shots, may walk less than golfers who have to chase after more shots in the rough — but the foundation's research finds that even golfers using a motorized cart can burn about 1,300 calories during an 18-hole round.</p><p>\"There are lots of places you can't take a cart,\" Mona explains. You can't take it on the teeing grounds, the greens or in the bunkers. \"There's still a lot of walking involved even if you're riding in a cart.\"</p><p>There's also a mental boost for lots of players. \"There's rarely a bad day on the golf course,\" Gary Metzger says. \"You're breathing good air and looking around at the nice scenery.\"</p><p>And this stress-relieving benefit, people in our poll told us, is one of their top motivations for staying in the game.</p><p><em>Our Sports and Health series continues over the summer, based on the results of our </em><a href=\"http://media.npr.org/documents/2015/june/sportsandhealthpoll.pdf\">poll</a> <em>with the </em><a href=\"http://www.rwjf.org/\">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a><em> and the </em><a href=\"http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/\">Harvard T.H.
