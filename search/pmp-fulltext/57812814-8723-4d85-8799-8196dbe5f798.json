We use the July return of <em>Sailor Moon</em> as an excuse to talk about everything from <em>Girl Meets World</em> to <em>Hocus Pocus</em>, <em>George of the Jungle</em>, <em>Newsies</em>, <em>Transformers</em> and more.</p><p>Then it's on to the topic of covers — not cover <em>songs</em>, mind you, but actual cover art. In music, that means lamenting the endless shrinkage of album covers from mural-sized fold-out vinyl sleeves to the minuscule avatars we see today. For books, we dig a bit deeper, discussing <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/19-book-cover-cliches\">clichés</a>, coding, color schemes, Kindles and more. Along the way, that brings talk of <a href=\"http://qz.com/207527/the-reason-every-book-about-africa-has-the-same-cover-and-its-not-pretty/\">books about Africa</a>, Jonathan Franzen's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/09/30/140918939/freedom-franzens-novel-earns-high-praise\"><em>Freedom</em></a>, the <a href=\"http://rainbowrowell.com/blog/book/eleanor-park/\">books of</a> <a href=\"http://rainbowrowell.com/blog/book/attachments/\">Rainbow</a> <a href=\"http://rainbowrowell.com/blog/book/landline/\">Rowell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.chipkidd.com/gallery.html\">Chip Kidd</a>'s designs, and <em><a href=\"http://www.junotdiaz.com/books/the-brief-wondrous-life-of-oscar-wao/\">The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</a></em>.</p><p>And, as always, we close with what's making us happy. I sing the praises of a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/tags/306227993/roku\">new way</a> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thisisnpr/2014/05/27/305685624/five-tiny-desk-concerts-you-have-to-watch-on-nprs-new-roku-channel\">to watch</a> Tiny Desk Concerts, while Kat is happy about the response to an absurdly <a href=\"http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Chopsticks/492F,default,pd.html\">high-end product</a>. Gene joins me in celebrating sports, though our opinions vary on his favored icon. And Linda offers up a grab bag, from her growing nephews to yelling-intensive TV to a <em>Mad Men</em> moment.</p><p>And, of course, she reminds you of what every man, woman and child in America should know by now: We're having another <em>Pop Culture Happy Hour</em> live show, this time to celebrate Episode No. 200!
