He has dedicated his life to documenting the area's small towns and farmers.</p><p>Last year, he says he realized what had been a mild drought was now severe. It had simply stopped raining.</p><p>\"It was kind of a daily surreal thing to walk outside,\" Black says.</p><p>Last month, Gov. Jerry Brown <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/04/01/396859879/california-governor-issues-1st-ever-statewide-mandatory-water-reductions\">announced</a> the first mandatory water restrictions in the state's history, as California endures its fourth year of drought.</p><p>The Central Valley makes up less than 1 percent of U.S. farmland, but grows a quarter of the nation's food. Black says if the drought continues, it could be a problem not just for the state, but the entire country.</p><p>\"What I've seen is this landscape of abundance become this landscape of scarcity,\" he says.</p><p>His images show a region covered with dust and tumbleweeds. \"It strikes you kind of at a very visceral level to go to a place that not too many years ago was green and lush and full of food,\" he says. \"This landscape has been humbled.\"</p><p>The focus of Black's photography, he says, is on documenting the drought's impact on communities that he believes rarely receive the attention they deserve.</p><p>Sheep farmers, for example, have worked in the Central Valley for generations. Now, their industry could meet its end within a matter of years, in part because of the drought.</p><p>For farmers, it's a yearly struggle to bring in these crops even under the best of circumstances. Still, he says, people aren't giving up.</p><p>\"People are not folding up and moving out,\" he says. \"They are trying to figure out a way to make it work. I think the hope really lies in that.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
