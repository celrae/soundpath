But I think that we all did the job correctly and I hope that people appreciate and like the finished version.</p><p>Something that I already knew, but that was reinforced [while doing the show], is that bad things happen in the world. And the answer is not to shy away from them, but instead to address them.</p><p><strong>On her move to New York City, and its similarities with her character's </strong></p><p>I grew up in St. Louis and I moved to New York after college.</p><p>And I am absolutely not comparing St. Louis to an underground post-apocalyptic bunker. I'm going on record <em>not</em> saying that. But certainly New York is unique, and it's overwhelming, and it's exciting, and it's difficult, and it's vibrant. And I think adjusting to that can be tough. So I certainly felt like that.</p><p>I don't know if it was my first day, but certainly my first week being in the city, a lady on the sidewalk stopped and asked me if I would be interested in getting a free blowout. ...</p><p>So I said, \"Of course!\" And she said, \"All I need is your credit card.\"</p><p>And I whipped out my credit card and gave it to her on the street, and she did one of those old-fashioned, like, Xerox copies of it.</p><p>And afterwards, I don't know why she needed my credit card if it was a reportedly free blowout. But strangely nothing happened. I did get my free blowout. I don't still know why she needed my credit card.</p><p>But I learned my lesson quickly, like you don't have to be nice to everyone who asks for your credit card on the streets of New York.</p><p><strong>On being cast as relentlessly upbeat characters</strong></p><p>I will say, I think one reason is I do have a large face. And when I smile, it's like a big smile, just because it's in proportion to the rest of my face.</p><p>So there could lie a naturally sort of sunny, go-to image, because I have a big moon-faced smile.</p><p>But I do hope I share some of the optimism in real life of these characters. ...</p><p>I played the character Erin on <em>The Office</em> and Becca in <em>Bridesmaids,</em> and these were both very sunny, upbeat women. And with Kimmy, I think what's very cool about her is just the toughness that's inside. And I would hope that I share some of that — I don't know if I do.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
