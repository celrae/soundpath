In April, Riken even <a href=\"http://www.riken.jp/en/pr/press/2014/20140401_2/\">concluded</a> that Haruko Obokata, the main Japanese scientist, was guilty of scientific misconduct.</p><p>The scientists involved in the work, including <a href=\"https://research.bwhanesthesia.org/research-groups/cterm/statement\">Charles Vacanti</a> at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, issued statements regretting the problems with the papers and agreeing that they should be retracted.</p><p>\"I am deeply saddened by all that has transpired, and after thoughtful consideration of the errors presented in the Riken report and other concerns that have been raised, I have agreed to retract the papers,\" Vacanti wrote in a statement.</p><p>But Vacanti and Obokata said they still believed their techniques could work. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.riken.jp/en/pr/topics/2014/20140630_1/\">Riken recently agreed</a> to allow Obokata to participate in an experiment aimed at attempting to reproduce the original results.</p><p>For its part, the journal <em>Nature</em> <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/1.15488\">said</a> it was reviewing its policies to try to prevent future flawed papers from being published and published retractions of the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v511/n7507/full/nature13598.html\">two</a> original <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v511/n7507/full/nature13599.html\">papers</a> as well as the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v511/n7507/full/511040a.html\">editorial</a> that accompanied them.</p><p>\"The episode has further highlighted flaws in <em>Nature</em>'s procedures and in the procedures of the institutions that publish with us,\" the journal said.</p><p>Brigham and Women's and Harvard both issued statements expressing regret about the case.</p><p>\"We are fully committed to upholding the highest standards of ethics and to rigorously maintaining the integrity of our research. Any concerns brought to our attention are thoroughly reviewed in accordance with institutional policies and applicable regulations,\" Harvard's statement said.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
