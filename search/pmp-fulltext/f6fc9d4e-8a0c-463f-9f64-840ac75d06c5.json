But sometimes, we like to top off our live events with a little bonus madness, so that's what's on tap this week.</p><p>Before we get underway, we decided to let you hear the part where Stephen and Glen sold <a href=\"http://shop.npr.org/catalogsearch/result/?q=pop+culture+happy+hour\" target=\"_blank\">our merch</a> — as well as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Superman-Unauthorized-Biography-Glen-Weldon/dp/1118341848/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420206229&sr=8-1&keywords=superman+the+unauthorized+biography\" target=\"_blank\">Glen's book</a> — because I find it amusing when other people have to vamp while I prepare myself for Quiz Time.</p><p>Then, our friends Matt Thompson and Kat Chow take a quiz about toys, in which Matt contemplates Barbies and Kat contemplates Baby Alive.</p><p>It wouldn't be a quiz segment without forcing some of our radio friends to play with us, so our other quiz sets the great Audie Cornish against the great Bob Mondello in a crazy battle over holiday television.</p><p>And finally, we take some questions from the audience.</p><p>Thanks so much to all of you for listening to the show this year, and a special shout to those of you who have found your way to any of our live events. It's always so good to see you (I will not lie: having a joke work in front of all of you is intoxicating), and we're so grateful.
