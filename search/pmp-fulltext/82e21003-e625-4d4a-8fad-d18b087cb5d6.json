I was so glad to be in the car, I would have ridden in the <em>trunk</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> All right, there you go, Jerod. So, basically, it <em>is</em> rude to ask these things. Just be happy you have a ride.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> And, you probably will be, according to John.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> Beggars can’t be choosers is sort of true.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<h2>Several Very Good Reasons to Keep One’s Shoes On</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Here’s something from David in Fort Collins, Colorado. David writes:</p>\n<br />\n<p>“Now that we’re in the warm weather season, I notice some people slipping off their sandals and placing bare feet on objects other than the floor in public settings: airplane seats, coffee shop furniture, etc. Can you provide some guidance on the proper manners with regards to bare feet in public?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> Well, if you have your shoes off, remember, there’s “shrimpers” that have foot fetishes, and they’re always thinking dirty about your feet. So, wherever you are, you don’t realize that you’re shrimper bait.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Another thing: I would never… I see people in the plane walk into the bathroom with bare feet.&nbsp; Where you <em>know</em> you miss — it’s on the floor some. So, you’re basically walking through a <em>lake</em> of urine. So, I think it’s a bad idea, yeah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> So, just never take your shoes off in public, much less place them on anything.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> Well, unless you’re a shrimper!&nbsp; Unless you’re looking for a <em>date</em>, or unless you want to go in the men’s room or the ladies room and get shrimped on the airplane, maybe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> So, John, do you get emails that update you on ‘shrimpers’ and subcultures just so you’re up on them?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> No, but I know shrimpers. There’s whole <em>books</em> about shrimpers. Shrimping is a fairly normal thing to do <em>once</em>…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I just didn’t know it was called “shrimping.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> You’ve never shrimped anybody?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Not that I know of.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> Well, you maybe want to try it. It’s safe! Can’t get pregnant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Wow.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Making Friends with Motorcyclists</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Here’s something from J.R. in Los Angeles:</p>\n<br />\n<p>“On long stretches of road, I’ll often be driving near big groups of motorcyclists. Sometimes they zoom around me and swarm in a way that’s annoying, and kind of dangerous. The last think I’d want to do is get ornery with a posse of motor bikers, but someone should say something, right? John?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> I’d just yell to ‘em, and say, “Hi, come on over!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> You like bikers?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> I like bikers, and they always like me too. I always get along with bikers. I think they’re kind of fun — I like the ones that are in the groups that are so dangerous that you’re not allowed to say the name out loud unless you’re one of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> But if they do swarm you, that could be frightening in traffic.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> I would be flattered!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> You’re all for it.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> If they swarm my car, I would be waving! “Hi, whatcha doing? Pull over!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Invite them along. Invite them in as part as your life.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Some people like feet, some people like bikers.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> Some people like both!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<h2>The Glamorous Life of a Kid from Baltimore</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> All right, we have our last question — it’s a question we ask all of our etiquette guests — and the question, and I can’t wait to hear this, is:</p>\n<br />\n<p>“What is the most memorable get-together you’ve ever been to? Details please?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> I think the most glamorous was I was on the jury at the Cannes Film Festival, and Jean Moreau, the French actress, was the head of it.&nbsp; And just hanging out with her for two weeks was the most glamorous thing in my life.&nbsp; I used to just whisper in her ear every night, “<em>More free food</em>,” which would make her laugh. Oh, it was great! It was great.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Did you ever think, in those situations, you know — you’re a kid from Baltimore…</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote data-pullquote=\"q\">\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> Yeah! I’d think, “Wow, this is a long way from Lutherville, Maryland.” It just means you can do anything you want. <q>My advice to all young people is: A ‘no’ is free. Keep asking for what you want, and have no pride.</q></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> There you go.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> And you’ll get there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> All right. A final bit of advice from John Waters. John, thanks for telling our audience how to behave.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>John Waters:</strong> Thank you. And I hope they listen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br /></div>","published":"2014-06-13T07:09:48+00:00","audio":[{"type":"image/jpeg","href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/73312023sq.jpg","meta":{"height":null,"crop":"primary","width":null}},{"meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/73312023sq2.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"type":"audio/mpeg","href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2014/06/13/0613_waters_128.mp3","meta":{"duration":526,"api":{"href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm_audio:/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2014/06/13/0613_waters","type":"application/json"},"duration_hms":"00:08:46"},"format":"MP3"}]}
