Dubon says the company files more than 600 patents every year.</p><p>\"Some of these become the seed for other ideas with practical use,\" he says.</p><p>Still, Dubon says, \"There are some very clever people here that have fantastic ideas. And who knows? Maybe one day they will come to light.\"</p><p>In the meantime, Airbus may want to start redesigning the drink carts to handle curves.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
