I would really <em>love</em> to take you to the airport, but, you know, my brother just got engaged and I have to go over to their house to celebrate.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Basically, lie.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Katie Burbank:</strong> Good one. What if you don’t have a brother?</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> Well, if you don’t have a brother, make it a cousin. Everybody has cousins!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong>&nbsp; You could just say: “You know, they’re building a train to the airport.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Katie Burbank:</strong> I’ll definitely lead with that next time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> “You know there’s a thing called ‘Uber,’ right?”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> It is true, though — in L.A., you’re really putting somebody on the spot. Because you know the answer is, “No, I <em>don’t</em> want to take you to the airport!&nbsp; Because I freaking <em>hate</em> that airport!”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> [to Rico] I thought your cousin was engaged! I’m learning so much tonight.</p>\n<br />\n<p>All right, Katie, that’s your answer.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Does that answer your question?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Katie Burbank</strong>: Yeah, I can use either of those.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> Oh, good.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Katie Burbank:</strong> Or just divert to Uber.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Cousin it up.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Thank you, Katie. Good question. All right, this next question comes from Manuel Guzman…</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> …Somebody get that man a mic.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Manuel Guzman:</strong> You can just go ahead and read it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> You want us to read it? OK. This is a good question.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> All right. Here we go. It is:</p>\n<br />\n<p>“If you arrive at a dinner party with your spouse or significant other, and you spot somebody with whom you’ve previously had a secret liaison… is it poor form to introduce your present companion to the latter?”</p>\n<br />\n<p>That is a man who’s read some Jackie Collins’s books, ladies and gentlemen! Yes!</p>\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/4126-1535.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/4126-1535.jpg\" alt=\"Photos: c 2014 Bill Youngblood / SCPR\" /></a><br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> I think, yeah, if you want to make him jealous, then you definitely introduce him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> But it’s a <em>secret</em> liaison. They don’t know.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> Well, if you’re with somebody that you’re kind of bored with, then you take the secret liaison and you say, “Let’s just catch up.” And you go in the bathroom and you have great sex. And you don’t tell your date!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Wow. I love your answers: It’s like “Lying/Great sex/Lying/ Great sex.” It’s like college.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> I think that would work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I like how you ask this question, Manuel. You ask, “Is it poor form?” It was poor form to have a secret liaison in the first place!</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Manuel Guzman:</strong> Well, you know, things happen in the past.&nbsp; And a gentleman does have his secrets.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rich Sommer:</strong> Do <em>you</em>have secrets?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Not any more!</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Manuel Guzman:</strong> No, no, no, this is strictly hypothetical!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Because this <em>is</em> nationally broadcast.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Yeah. And <em>this</em> isn’t radio. These people can all see you.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rich Sommer:</strong> It’s pretty <em>specific</em> for a purely hypothetical question…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Manuel Guzman:</strong> Yeah, please insert the black bar over my eyes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> All right, so… “have sex.” I think is the answer.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Just have sex. Lie.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Manuel Guzman:</strong> Works for me!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br /></div>","published":"2014-06-27T02:05:42+00:00","audio":[{"meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg","href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/4126-2455.jpg"},{"type":"image/jpeg","href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/4126-2399.jpg","meta":{"width":null,"height":null,"crop":"primary"}},{"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/4126-1535.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"width":null,"crop":"primary","height":null}},{"format":"MP3","type":"audio/mpeg","href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2014/06/27/0627_collins_128.mp3","meta":{"duration_hms":"00:07:25","duration":445,"api":{"type":"application/json","href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm_audio:/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2014/06/27/0627_collins"}}}]}
