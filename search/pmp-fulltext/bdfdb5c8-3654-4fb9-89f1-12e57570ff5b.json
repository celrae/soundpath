It covers everything from river health to spotted owls to the timber industry. They’re seeing some interesting things – namely that old growth forests have decreased about 3% since the plan was put in place in 1994. Spotted owls continue their slow decline as well. Most of the habitat destruction has not been due to logging, as some may think – wildfire has actually been the biggest culprit.”</p><p>The Forest Service is beginning the broader process of updating the Northwest Forest Plan. This report card provides the scientific backdrop for changes to come.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 KLCC-FM.
