When we asked Guy about coming on the show, we learned that pop-culture-wise, he — like our own Stephen Thompson — spends a lot of time sharing stuff with his kids. So this seemed like a good week to get around to Disney's current hit, <em>Big Hero 6</em>. But not just that! We also cover new shows on Amazon, old films Stephen will harass you into seeing, and lots more.</p><p>In honor of Thanksgiving, we decided to also spend a few minutes this week on leftovers — in other words: outtakes. Why are people fascinated by other people cracking up? Why is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCCFTLswP-o&feature=youtu.be&t=2m2s\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> my favorite blooper ever? And what happened when Stephen was asked to freestyle some material for our producer, Jessica, to use in putting the show together?</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about food (naturally) and some of the shows his kids dig. Glen is happy about <a href=\"http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/flop-house\" target=\"_blank\">a film podcast</a> for which he says he's \"a partisan.\" Guy is happy about having found <a href=\"http://www.momastore.org/museum/moma/CategoryDisplay_10451_10001_26708_56161_-1_Y_Kickstarter%20at%20MoMA__1000\" target=\"_blank\">a crossover</a> between crowdfunding and fine art.
