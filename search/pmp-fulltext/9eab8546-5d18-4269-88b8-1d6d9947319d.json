So it’s more fun to talk about than the trans woman of color who was murdered, right? It’s not as fun, it’s not as heartwarming. It hurts to talk about those things. It hurts to see that side of humanity. So I think that a lot of emphasis is put on marriage because it’s just easier to talk about.”</p></blockquote>        <div  class=\"responsive-media\" style=\"height:450px; padding-bottom:10px;\">            <iframe style=\"height:450px; padding-bottom:10px;\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/171359784&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>        </div><p>Smith says there have been 25 acts of violence against transgender people in Salt Lake City so far this year, and transgender people of color are most at risk.</p><p>Through Smith, Rachel met 20 year-old Gabriel Glissmeyer, a black transgender college student and activist, who was adopted and raised by a white Mormon family in Utah.</p><p>Rachel asked Glissmeyer what the biggest issue is that he’s working to combat:</p><blockquote><p>“The biggest thing that I’m combatting every day is just staying alive at this point. It’s terrible having to leave my house and just being like – this could be the last time I see my family and this is the last time I could see my friends. And so just leaving my house is terrifying for me at this point, but I still do it because there’s so much work I need to do, and there’s so many lives I need to change and people who need to hear me.”</p></blockquote>        <div  class=\"responsive-media\" style=\"height:450px; padding-bottom:10px;\">            <iframe style=\"height:450px; padding-bottom:10px;\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/171376691&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true\"></iframe>        </div><p>&#8220;Gabe told me that he fears for his life every day not because he’s perceived as transgender, but because he’s perceived as a black male,&#8221; Rachel said. &#8220;He wants what he calls &#8216;real world issues&#8217; like police brutality, gun violence and domestic violence to be part of the LGBT conversation.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul style=\"color: #000000\"><li><a style=\"color: #2c95c7\" href=\"http://www.wbur.org/about/people/rachel-rohr\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rachel Rohr</strong></a>, social media and web producer for Here & Now, and host of the podcast “Alternate Routes.” She tweets <a style=\"color: #2c95c7\" href=\"https://twitter.com/LionTalk\" target=\"_blank\">@LionTalk</a>.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
