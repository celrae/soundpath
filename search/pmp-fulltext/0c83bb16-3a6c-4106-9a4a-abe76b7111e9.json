But if you haven't, we hope you'll still get a lot out of our chat with our pal Barrie Hardymon about the book and the film, the performances of Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck, and the distinction between a mystery story and a suspense thriller, which <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2012/10/19/163235036/pop-culture-happy-hour-the-nature-of-suspense-and-our-love-of-cover-songs\" target=\"_blank\">we used this very book to discuss</a> almost two years ago.</p><p>From there, we move on to a more philosophical question: What has pop culture taught us? Not just the life lessons, but the very practical things like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSAaiYKF0cs\" target=\"_blank\">chemical elements</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPN3KTtrnZM\" target=\"_blank\">names of cheeses</a>. (And also the names of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQHaGhC7C2E\" target=\"_blank\">mathematicians</a> who are described in song as advocating plagiarism, although we should clarify: it's <em>in the song</em> that he advocates plagiarism. The song is a parody; you could write a similar one about anybody.) We somehow wind up once again on the topic of food television and apartment painting, and <em>completely by chance</em>, Stephen mentions the Jan Hooks speech in <em>Pee-wee's Big Adventure</em> that taught him about the Alamo (at a taping we did a couple of days before her death was reported Thursday).</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Barrie is being made happy by the \"small bald host\" <a href=\"http://www.travelchannel.com/tv-shows/bizarre-foods\" target=\"_blank\">of a show</a> she's come to very much enjoy. Stephen is being made happy by the <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/articles/area-teens-wed-horrible-life-awaits-pair,20603/\" target=\"_blank\">hilarious resurfacing of a photo</a> he was surprised to see float by him again, but also about his editing playlist, from which we've pasted some highlights below. Glen is happy about <em>Twin Peaks</em>, but also about two upcoming comics capitalizing on something you already know he loves.
