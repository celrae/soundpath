We follow up with a new track from <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/239718803/the-bots\">The Bots</a>, two young brothers from L.A. whose \"All I Really Want\" is a two-minute sugar rush of high-powered pop-punk.</p><p>Later on the show we welcome NPR Music's Daoud Tylerâ€“Ameen and Jacob Ganz to the studio to play some of their favorite new tunes. Daoud opts for \"Explanation,\" a punchy rock number from Ohio trio Delay, while Jacob plays <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/167801992/perfume-genius\">Perfume Genius</a>' surging new track \"Queen.\"</p><p>Daoud and Jacob stick around as Robin puts on \"Hegemony,\" a super-melodic, percussion-heavy track from Zammuto, the project of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/127832406/the-books\">The Books</a>' Nick Zammuto, recorded in a Vermont shed. Finally, Bob rounds out the show with a premiere from long-dormant rock group The Rentals, called \"1000 Seasons\" that features Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/230150589/lucius\">Lucius</a> on vocals.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
