But the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nprmusic/status/528236759961051136\" target=\"_blank\">opening act</a> kept jumping on the piano and nibbling on the set, literally pulling up the carpet and leaving \"presents\" on the floor. How could we not have them back? Did I mention they're hamsters?</p><p>Joni and Nash — first names only, please, like Madonna and Cher — are HMSTR. Certainly not the first band to count rodents among its members, but at least they refuse to release a punk album with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipmunk_Punk\" target=\"_blank\">no punk to be found</a>. \"Snow Day\" is HMSTR's first single, a twee-as-all-get-out holiday pop-punk song by virtue of having \"snow\" in its title. After what sounds like digital snowflakes, the song unleashes a one-minute snowball fight with the fuzziest Tiny Desk destroyers we've ever seen.</p><p>You can download \"Snow Day\" from <a href=\"https://hmstrband.bandcamp.com/track/snow-day\" target=\"_blank\">HMSTR's Bandcamp page</a>.
