But one thing I can tell you is it&#8217;s becoming a bigger problem as the prison population ages and has more people with chronic medical conditions, more people on medications that make them heat sensitive, and as the weather is changing and we have hotter summers, at least in certain parts of the country.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On his own experience in overheated cells</strong></p><p>&#8220;I was in the cells in the Wisconsin super-max &#8230; I&#8217;ve also been, last July and August, in the Arizona state prison system, where we currently have a lawsuit ongoing that involves this issue. And it was absolutely unbearable, even for short periods of time, and I&#8217;m a person in reasonably good health. I don&#8217;t have any particular risk factors for heat injury, but it was inconceivable to me that I could survive these conditions for more than a very short period of time. But prisoners in Arizona, of course, are exposed to these conditions for days and weeks at a time during the hot summer months.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On why he believes this is a constitutional issue</strong></p><p>&#8220;Several courts have said that extreme heat violates the Constitution. The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, and what the Supreme Court has said is that prisons can&#8217;t expose prisoners to conditions that pose a substantial risk of serious harm. Prisons don&#8217;t have to be comfortable, but they have to be safe, and they can&#8217;t expose prisoners to an unreasonable risk of injury or death. And so several courts have already ruled that extreme heat does pose such a great risk, at least to some prisoners, that it violates the Eighth Amendment.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/author/david-fathi\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>David Fathi</strong></a>, director of the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights\" target=\"_blank\">ACLU National Prison Project</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
