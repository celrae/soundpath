On the day of a Pick Six carryover, his top selections captured the first three legs of the wager, paying $11.60, $15.80 and $10, and then he nailed an impossible-looking $27.60 winner who helped produce a Pick Six return of $78,716.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"Blood-Horse Triple Crown\" href=\"http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/features/waiting-and-waiting-for-crowning-glory-629\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Blood-Horse: </strong>Waiting, and Waiting, for Crowning Glory</a> &#8211; &#8220;In the same room with the banners at the Louisville museum, a podium rises about six feet from the ground to ensure prime viewing of a silver trophy with gold studs.

When he started, he wasn&#8217;t an underdog, he was a no-chance. He makes &#8217;09 Kentucky Derby winner Mine That Bird, a 50-1 longshot, look like the 10th seed in a tennis tournament. If California Chrome were one of those young pitchers from India earning a pro baseball contract and featured in the current movie &#8216;Million Dollar Arm,&#8217; he would have gone on to pitch a no-hitter in the seventh game of the World Series.&#8221;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
