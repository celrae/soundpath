Three-fourths only fill out an application with one lender.</p><p>Richard Cordray, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, says there may be a few reasons consumers aren't comparison shopping for loans.</p><p>\"It is a surprising finding, and it suggests that they're still fairly intimidated by the mortgage transaction,\" he says. \"Or they're a little distracted because, at the same time, they're picking out a house.\"</p><p>But Cordray explains how costly the oversight can be, using as an example a $200,000 loan at rates of either 4 percent or 4.5 percent.</p><p>\"The difference in even a half percent of interest racks up pretty quickly over five years to about $3,500 — and over the life of a 30-year loan, obviously, far more than that,\" Cordray says. \"So this is real money for people — meaningful money.\"</p><p>In response, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home\" target=\"_blank\">is launching a set of online tools today</a> to make these comparisons and decisions easier for U.S. homebuyers. One, for instance, will let a user plug in their credit score and ZIP code to generate a range of interest rates being offered by lenders that day.</p><p>But there may be psychological hurdles to overcome as well as the informational ones, says Brigitte Madrian, a Harvard economist who studies how human nature gets in the way of us making better financial decisions.</p><p>The first is that buyers fail to recognize the huge difference that a small number like half of 1 percent can make over time.</p><p>\"Consumers don't really understand compound interest. This has been documented in lots of different research studies,\" Madrian says.</p><p>Those small percentages, when factored in again and again, have an immense cumulative effect: Consider, for instance, how even the relatively low inflation rates in recent decades have increased prices by 50 percent since 1996.</p><p>Another thing our brains do, Madrian says, is look at cost savings in relative terms. The phenomenon, impressively named the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics, can make saving hundreds of dollars seem less worthwhile than saving $10.</p><p>\"If a store is offering a discount — you know, $10 on a $30 pair of shoes, that's a 33 percent discount — people will drive 20 minutes out of their way to get that discount, because it's a big relative difference in price,\" she says. \"Whereas they might not drive 20 minutes out of their way to save $300 on a car if that $300 is only 1 percent of the price of a car, because 1 percent seems small.\"</p><p>The federal government is hoping that its new mortgage tools can help break through these mental blocks to convince Americans just how valuable .5 percent can be — and give them a better chance to realize those thousands of dollars in savings.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
