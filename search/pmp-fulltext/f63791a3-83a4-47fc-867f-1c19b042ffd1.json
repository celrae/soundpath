It's really overwhelming because you have so many people telling you what you need to change.”</p>\n<p>When asked about how school here compares with her school on the outside, she doesn't have an easy time answering.</p>\n<p>“I can't really say because I never really went,” she says. “No one noticed that I was gone. I would ask to go to the bathroom and come back high and no one noticed the difference.”</p>\n<p>Here, she says, she feels like her teachers know what's going on and care. “It's really comforting because it's like oh, other people notice me, I'm getting attention that I've been deprived of for so many years,” she says.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/190313835&amp;color=00cc11&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" ></iframe></p>\n<p>Superintendent Jones says it’s that kind of personal connection that matters most. No amount of technology can substitute for that.</p>\n<p>But, she says, making sure kids in the system get a quality education on the inside improves their chances of succeeding on the outside.</p>\n<p>“To affect change on the front end, rather than waiting until the far end, yeah it is a little costly, financially and resource wise,” Jones says. “But long term if it keeps kids out of prison or keeps kids out of the system or re-offending and all of the ripple effects financially, it's actually pretty cheap.”</p>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"pd-embed\" id=\"pd_1424726363\" ></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n//<![CDATA[\n  var _polldaddy = [] || _polldaddy;<\\/p><p>  _polldaddy.push( {\n    type: \"iframe\",\n    auto: \"1\",\n    domain: \"marketplaceapm.polldaddy.com/s/\",\n    id: \"education-on-inside-survey-wy\",\n    placeholder: \"pd_1424726363\"\n  } );<\\/p><p>  (function(d,c,j){if(!document.getElementById(j)){var pd=d.createElement(c),s;pd.id=j;pd.src=('https:'==document.location.protocol)?'https://polldaddy.com/survey.js':'http://i0.poll.fm/survey.js';s=document.getElementsByTagName(c)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(pd,s);}}(document,'script','pd-embed'));\n//]]>\n</script></div>","audio":[{"meta":{"crop":"primary","width":"610","height":"340"},"href":"http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/Girls%20School%20Logo_0.jpg?itok=9R2Rorxo","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/marketplace/segments/2015/02/23/mp_20150223_seg_20_64.mp3","meta":{"duration":471,"duration_hms":"00:07:51","api":{"href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm-audio:/marketplace/segments/2015/02/23/mp_20150223_seg_20","type":"application/json"}},"format":"MP3","type":"audio/mpeg"}]}
