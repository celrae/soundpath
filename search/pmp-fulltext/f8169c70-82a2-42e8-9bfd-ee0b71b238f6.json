We're throwing open the doors to embedding, putting our audio on your site.</p><p>Put <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2015/04/01/392767067/engineer-turned-cabbie-helps-new-refugees-find-their-way\">a great Morning Edition story</a> on your Tumblr.</p><p>Post <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2015/04/21/401080634/all-songs-considered-hear-brand-new-my-morning-jacket-more\">the new All Songs Considered episode</a> on your WordPress.</p><p>We've offered NPR audio embedding before — but only sporadically and never at this scale. Just about every piece of audio on NPR.org will now provide the option.</p><p>If you publish on the Web, you'll find it easy to embed and share our audio:</p><p><strong>1. Find a story or show or song you love.</strong> On NPR.org, you'll now see an embed option nearly everywhere you're able to play audio. The option will say \"embed\" or show a \"<>\" icon (the Web's universal embed symbol).</p><p><strong>2. Get the embed code.</strong> Click or tap the embed option, and you'll see a snippet of code. Try it on the example below.</p><p><strong>3. Copy it.</strong> Copy and paste that snippet into the code of your blog post or elsewhere on the Web. NPR's player will appear when you publish.</p><p>That's it.</p><p>No matter their devices, visitors to your site will be able to play the NPR audio and tap the player's headline to see the full story on NPR.org. The new NPR embed is mobile-friendly and fully responsive to all sizes of digital screens.</p><p>You also now can expect embed-ability with almost all audio NPR publishes. For legal reasons, we can't offer embedding of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/music/radio\">our radio streams</a>, and sometimes we'll need to withhold select <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/music/\">NPR Music</a> exclusives. But these exceptions should be few.</p><p>Thanks for listening to NPR — and sharing your NPR listening around the Web. If you run into issues, contact us <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/contact/\">here</a>. We plan to make any fixes and add further enhancements to the player in coming weeks.</p><p><em>Patrick Cooper is NPR's director of Web and engagement.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
