As a reporter, I met Fuld many times, once in an elevator when he had heard I was doing a feature on the firm's \"extreme makeover\" into a powerhouse firm back in 2004. At the time, Lehman was making a strong push into the top tiers of investment banking, a standing it retained until its demise. Fuld surprised me; rather than being gruff or bossy, as was often rumored, he smiled shyly and politely, clearly worried about how his firm, so precious to him, would be portrayed in the press. The story of Lehman Brothers could be told through the story of Dick Fuld; he was a protective force for years, and he was emblematic of its tough-love culture: aggressive, but loyal in the end. When the firm started to collapse, many loyalists attributed it to Fuld being less involved and having passed on management to someone else. The infamous micromanager, who swaggered through the trading floors, had let go of power in early 2008 and to the minds of many at Lehman, he paid the price in September that year.
