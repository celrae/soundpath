How much more logical to utilize existing stadiums in neighboring countries, in large cities like Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Santiago.</p><p>As for the Olympics, rather than going through the notoriously rigorous process of voting for a new host city every few years, it would be sensible to pick three permanent sites, rotating them every Olympiad from Asia to Europe to the Americas â€” let's say, Tokyo to London to Los Angeles.</p><p>And even then, certain events could be allotted to nearby cities.
