This is from Bridgette in Pasadena, California. Bridgette writes – oh this is great for your movie – “If you’re in a museum or gallery and see someone touching an artwork, what should you do? Give them a baleful eye, politely say something to them or taste out a guard and rat them out?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> I think my first instinct… I think politeness is always a good first step before you bring out the knife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> The heavies.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> You <em>are</em> British after all.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> I think, yes, I think you can go and gently tap the person on the shoulder and say “Excuse me, do you know how long it took me to paint that?”</p>\n<br />\n<p>But no, obviously if someone is <em>defacing</em> a work of art in front of you, you hit the panic button.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Sure, I would think, but well… let me put it in maybe lighter terms, because this is something I’ve experienced: you know, there’s a sign that says “no photographs,” and someone’s taking pictures of it. Or they’re standing too close to it, you know.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> I mean, of course there’s the very British way of turning around, walking out of the museum as quickly as possible — running away from the problem!</p>\n<br />\n<p>But I think the other one, I think to engage people and say — without being cynical or sort of snooty about it — saying “Out of interest, why, when it’s asked you respectfully not to, do you?”</p>\n<br />\n<p>It was interesting. I took my son to an exhibition of avant-garde Russian art at Saatchi Gallery in London recently. Some of it amazing, and some of it really quite baffling.&nbsp; And in the corner there was a stepladder with a bucket near it, and I was studying this and I was thinking “Right, okay, so what’s the artist telling me about that?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> “It’s a readymade!”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> And — yeah — and of course then, in comes a guy in overalls, picks up the ladder, and walks up and starts cleaning the windows! I mean, in <em>those</em> circumstances I would fully engage with the notion of touching the art.&nbsp; But to do it to a Constable or Van Gogh, no.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> An artist might say your behavior should be “site-specific.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> That’s very good, a very good phrase.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Statute of Spoiler Limitations</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> All right. Our next question comes from John in Chicago. John writes, “What is the etiquette of TV show spoilers? For example, if something insane and conversation-worthy just happened on ‘Downton Abbey’ last night, how soon is too soon to talk about it within earshot of those whose viewing status I don’t know? There must be a time when all bets are off, right?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> Very interesting. That’s a very good one. It’s a bit like saying when is it time to stop saying Happy New Year, you know? It’s rounded somewhere around the third or fourth week of January, you think come on, we’ve done that, we don’t need to. I think there must be yes, there <em>must</em> be a time when all bets are off.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Having said that, you know one of the reasons I stopped doing Twitter so much — or certainly tweeting about “Downton Abbey” — is because the show goes out at different times all over the world. You know, South America has just had season two, China has just had season one…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> So you’re chock full of spoilers. I mean you have to hold these spoilers forever.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> I know. You know, I have to say, there were some very big spoilers in season three. Keeping quiet on that for a year was quite hard.</p>\n<br />\n<p>So I think… I would say a polite three weeks, and then you know, if you haven’t caught it by now…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Three weeks, all right.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> Two weeks, three weeks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Even in this world of Netflix and on demand?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> Well yeah… Maybe I’m gonna have to revise it to maybe <em>never</em>. In fact, never talk about <em>any</em> TV show <em>ever</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> That’s right.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>The Favourite Spellings of One’s Heritage</h2>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Katie in Westwood, California writes, “I am a Brit, now living in America. Should I spell words as I was taught, or as this country really, really wants me to? By the way, ‘Downton’ is my <em>favourite</em> show. That’s favourite spelled with an ou.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> I think Katie, I think you absolutely have to stick to your guns. You know — stick to the way you were brought up on this. Spelling is one thing that I get very twitchy about, when I do see the word “honor” as opposed to “honour,” and “color instead of “colour.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> So you’re saying that Katie, as a Brit, she needs to hold the Union Jack high.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> Yes — wave that flag Katie, wave that flag. But again, with discretion. I think when applying for a job as say, you know, working on a newspaper or something, you might want to adopt the local customs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> All right, but on a similar note — this is a pet peeve of mine — I hear BBC announcers call Barack Obama, “<em>Ba</em>rack Obama.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> So the stress is on the second syllable, on the Ba<em>rack</em>?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Ba-<em>rack</em>, that’s correct. They mess it up all the time!</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> I don’t know, the BBC does have a pronunciation unit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> They’re doing a terrible job.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> You know, when I get home I’m gonna ring them up and alert them. ‘ Ba<em>rack</em>.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Leader of the free world, Ba<em>rack</em> Obama.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> And Americans everywhere are like, “And <em>who is</em> the Prime Minister of England so we can mispronounce their name?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> Right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> “We’ll get you back!”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hugh Bonneville:</strong> Who is it this week? David “Cameroon.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> All right; Hugh “Bon-<em>nay-</em>ville”… thank you for telling our audience how to behave.</p>\n<br /></div>","audio":[{"type":"audio/mpeg","href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/dinnerpartydownload/2014/02/07/0207_bonneville_128.mp3","meta":{"api":{"href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm_audio:/dinnerpartydownload/2014/02/07/0207_bonneville","type":"application/json"},"duration":476,"duration_hms":"00:07:56"},"format":"MP3"}]}
