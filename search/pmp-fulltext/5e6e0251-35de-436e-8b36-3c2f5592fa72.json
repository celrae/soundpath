We talk about the movie's shaggy charms, its savvy development, and why it gives me joyful reason to gloat over past avowals of loyalty. We'll consider whether it's just <em>The Avengers </em><a href=\"http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/08/04/guardians-galaxy-marvel-avengers/\" target=\"_blank\">all over again</a>, and discuss the demands of getting ready for your (shirtless) close-up. (<a href=\"http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/building-a-bigger-action-hero-20140418\" target=\"_blank\">This</a> is the great piece we talk about briefly regarding action-star bodies. It's well worth your time.)</p><p>Next up, we certainly don't have an entire segment's worth of things to say about <em>Sharknado </em>and <em>Sha</em><em>rknado 2</em>, but we were inspired to think a little about the category of \"so bad it's good,\" and whether the charm of same is whittled away a bit when it's so incredibly obvious that the intent all along is Twitter mockery alone.</p><p>As always, we close with what's making us happy this week. If you heard our <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2014/08/04/337755561/boyhood-time-and-tree-rings\" target=\"_blank\">quick podcast segment</a> earlier this week, you know that Stephen and I both really enjoyed <em>Boyhood</em>, and he'll talk a little more about that. (We typically won't have that kind of overlap; this was our first week trying the Small Batch Edition and we weren't even sure we'd use it.) Glen is all excited about the arrival on disc of <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2014/07/twin-peaks-box-set-extras-guide.html\" target=\"_blank\">one of his favorites</a>. Chris is happy about a friend in <a href=\"http://dctheatrescene.com/2014/07/29/campsite-rule/\" target=\"_blank\">a play</a> those of you in D.C. have a chance to check out.
