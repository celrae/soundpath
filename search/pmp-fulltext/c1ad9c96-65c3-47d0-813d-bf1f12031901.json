My name is Thomas Pierce. I have a new book of short stories out, and I’m going to read from one of them now, called “Shirley Temple III.” It’s a story about a mother and a son, Mama and Tommy. Tommy is the host of a nature reality show called “Back From Extinction,” in which they actually bring back long-extinct animals from extinction. Mama is throwing a party when the story begins, a wedding party, and she’s waiting for her son to come home.

Tommy comes into the house through the back door. He pulls a flask out of his pocket and tips it into Daffy Duck.</p>\n<br />\n<p>“Follow me,” he says, and leads her into the back yard, both of them swatting their way through a veil of mosquitoes and moths attacking the overhead flood light.</p>\n<br />\n<p>There, in the freshly mowed grass, Tommy has something hidden under a quilt.

They’re the smallest mammoths that ever existed. Cute, isn’t she?”</p>\n<br />\n<p>The mammoth is waist-high, with a pelt of dirty blonde fur that hangs in tangled draggles to the dirt. Its tusks, white and pristine, curve out and up. The trunk probes the ground for god knows what, and then curls back into itself like a jelly roll.</p>\n<br />\n<p>“What’s a gosh-durned Bread&nbsp;Island Dwarf whatever doing in my yard?” Mama asked.</p>\n<br />\n<p>“Listen,” Tommy says. “This is very special. Other than the folks at work, you’re the first modern human to ever lay eyes on such a creature. Her episode hasn’t even aired yet. Go on, you can touch her. She’s friendly. Her name’s Shirley Temple.”</p>\n<br />\n<p>“Shirley Temple?” Mama asked. “You can’t name it that. Shirley Temple was Shirley Temple.”</p>\n<br />\n<p>She points to the dog pen, under which Shirley Temple the Great Dane is buried. The dog had tumors that couldn’t be removed.</p>\n<br />\n<p>“All right”, Tommy says. “I meant it to be honorific. Call this one Shirley Temple II, if you like. He puts his hands on the mammoth’s tusks. “Or, maybe we should call her Shirley Temple III, since technically, the first one was the “Good Ship Lollipop” Shirley Temple?”</p>\n<br />\n<p>He runs his hand along Shirley Temple III’s back. The mammoth looks up at him with dark, mysterious eyes. It doesn’t seem to know what to do in this new setting.</p>\n<br />\n<p>“Is it full-grown?”</p>\n<br />\n<p>“That’s what they tell me. Isn’t she amazing?”</p>\n<br />\n<p>Mama nods, because the mammoth really is a scientific miracle. A true marvel. But, then again. It’s getting late.
