In Baltimore, that's a lot of families.</span></p>\n<p><span>\"We want to provide meals to those kids that need them the most within our city,” says John Walker, interim director of Food and Nutrition Services for Baltimore City Public Schools. In many cases, he says, the only healthy meals students get during the day are the ones they eat at school.</span></p>\n<p><span>But this is about so much more than lunch. It’s about millions of dollars in school funding. That’s because Maryland, like many states, determines how much money school districts receive for disadvantaged students based on the number of kids who qualify for free and reduced-price lunches.</span></p>\n<p><span>“We get approximately $5,000 per child in state aid for every free and reduced student that we can identify as of October 31 each year,” says Walker. This year that adds up to more than $323 million.</span></p>\n<p><span>In other words,&nbsp; what starts with a free turkey sandwich, an apple and a carton of milk ends up driving more than a quarter of the district’s operating budget.

The $2 billion federal</span> <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oii/nonpublic/erate.html\">E-Rate program</a> <span>gives schools discounts of up to 90 percent on their telephone and internet service, based on free and reduced-price lunch rates. Many districts also use lunch to calculate federal funding for individual schools.</span></p>\n<p><span>At Baltimore's Rognel Heights,&nbsp; that could mean as much as $187,000 in funding. Principal Marie Parfait-Davis says that's money that pays for extra help in the classroom, new technology or books.</span></p>\n<p><span>“We desperately need all of our parents to fill out those lunch applications, because money is tied to those lunch applications,” Parfait-Davis says. “We definitely can’t afford to not get any extra funding.”</span></p>\n<p><span>But some critics of the process think having parents simply fill out a form, where they verify their own income, is too easy.</span></p>\n<p><span>\"There’s nothing wrong with that if there were checks and balances on the system,” says Lisa Snell, director of education and child welfare at the</span> <a href=\"http://reason.org/\">Reason Foundation</a><span>, a libertarian think tank. School districts typically have to verify just three percent of approved applications. In Baltimore, that's just a sliver of the district's 85,000 students.</span></p>\n<p><span>Snell points to a scandal in New Jersey last summer, where more than 100 public employees or their family members were accused of lying about their incomes to get free meals for their kids.</span></p>\n<p><span>“It would be one thing if it was just a free lunch that these kids were getting,” Snell says. “A lot of people say, ‘who cares, we don’t want kids to go hungry,’ but it’s actually billions of dollars in state and federal aid that are at stake.”</span></p>\n<p><span>A</span> <a href=\"http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/nutrition/apec.asp\">national study</a> <span>six years ago found that one in five families either qualified for benefits and shouldn’t have, because they earned too much, or they didn’t qualify and they should have.</span></p>\n<p><span>The USDA is repeating that study, says Kevin Concannon, who oversees</span> <a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/lunch/aboutlunch/NSLPFactSheet.pdf\">the program</a> <span>as Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</span></p>\n<p><span>“I am expecting that we will have seen a considerable reduction on that front,” he says.</span></p>\n<p><span>A reduction, he says, because a lot more kids are now enrolled automatically in the lunch program if their families receive food stamps or temporary cash assistance.
