I would wake up, I’d sit down at the piano, I’d play a song, and that’s the thing that brought me closest to Brian.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LOVEANDMERCY061431647781-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Photo Credit: Francois Duhamel \" />Paul Dano croons in a studio in “Love &amp;&nbsp;Mercy.” Photo Credit: Francois Duhamel<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Did you find there was something technical that happens in those songs that you hadn’t noticed before that maybe helps explain… You know, Lamont Dozier <a href=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/episodes/14/\" target=\"_blank\">was on our show</a>, who wrote a lot of great Motown songs. And I asked him if there’s some sort of magical, mystical chord change that just always results in a hit or something.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong> Well the early songs, definitely, they had a <em>thing</em>. But I’d say “Pet Sounds,” man… it’s still revealing itself to me.</p>\n<br />\n<p>I mean, one interesting thing about his piano playing is he played bass in the Beach Boys early on. &nbsp;He wrote on the piano, but he played bass live. &nbsp;And his left hand work on the piano is really impressive — like the bass lines in the left hand.&nbsp;He’s doing really cool stuff.</p>\n<br />\n<p>What’s amazing is the songs go down <em>so smooth</em> in your ear. &nbsp;But you <em>don’t</em> realize&nbsp;what he’s doing in terms of chord change, or a bass clarinet, or a timpani, or a whatever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Yeah, there’s everything but the kitchen sink in these songs, but they don’t sound like a cacophony.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong> Exactly, and that’s kind of the peak of art, that you could do something that nobody’s done before, but it just goes right down.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Tastes like candy.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LOVEANDMERCY091431647888-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Photo Credit: Francois Duhamel \" />Photo Credit: Francois Duhamel<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> We have two questions that we ask everyone on the show. The first is: if we were to meet you at a dinner party, what question should we not ask you?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong> Ooh<em>…</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> I can tell you what you said <a href=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/episodes/47/\">last time</a>&nbsp;you were on the show.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong> Oh, really? I’d be curious.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> You said that you didn’t like being asked what led you to become an actor. And you hated it because you didn’t know.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong> Really? That’s so interesting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Do you know now?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong> What I realized, actually, doing this film, was that I think I got into acting because of singing. Because I think singing in school led to doing school plays and musicals, which led to me doing musicals and plays in New York theater.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Oh, wow.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong>&nbsp;But hmmm… Don’t ask me at a dinner party… I guess, you know, don’t ask me about the weather. Let’s real talk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> See, I live in L.A. so we don’t. &nbsp;We just take that as a given.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong> Yeah, right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> It’s going to be sunny and not raining again.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Our second question is kind of the flip of that: Tell us something we don’t know.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong>&nbsp;OK…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Last time around, <a href=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/episodes/47/\" target=\"_blank\">you told us you had a bacon fetish</a>.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong> Ohhh. &nbsp;Why did I say that. &nbsp;It’s true…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> It’s too late. It’s out there.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong>&nbsp;…It’s true. I’m proud of that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> If you’re stumped, I have something I could bring up, but… you can tell me not to.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong> Yeah, bring it up, bring it up, bring it up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> I have it on good authority — interestingly, for somebody who plays a lot of intense and edgy roles — that you are a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzhLQWDZM0Q\">Phish</a> fan.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, that is <em>true</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Phish the jam band.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Paul Dano:</strong> You know what’s funny about that? So, I live in Brooklyn, and I think just being an actor and in certain films that are hip, I’ve gotten asked before in these kind of interviews,&nbsp;“So, are you a hipster?”</p>\n<br />\n<p>And I’ve always thought, “Well, if I tell them that I like Phish… I’m pretty sure that’s like&nbsp;the <em>least</em> hipster thing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br /></div>","title":"Paul Dano Delves into Brian Wilson’s Troubled Genius in ‘Love & Mercy’","itags":["PMP:The_Dinner_Party_Download_PMP","The Dinner Party Download","The Dinner Party Download 2015-06-12","e6c3eab5c34a68c05e8e3fbb0f83cd80"],"audio":[{"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LOVEANDMERCY061431647781.jpg","meta":{"height":null,"crop":"primary","width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LOVEANDMERCY051431647667.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"width":null,"height":null,"crop":"primary"}},{"type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"height":null,"crop":"primary","width":null},"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LOVEANDMERCY091431647888.jpg"},{"meta":{"width":null,"height":null,"crop":"primary"},"type":"image/jpeg","href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LOVEANDMERCY011431647752.jpg"},{"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Dano-square.png","type":"image/png","meta":{"width":null,"crop":"primary","height":null}},{"format":"MP3","type":"audio/mpeg","meta":{"duration_hms":"00:09:20","duration":560,"api":{"type":"application/json","href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm_audio:/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2015/06/12/0612goh"}},"href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2015/06/12/0612goh_128.mp3"}]}
