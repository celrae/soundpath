The execution would be carried out by lethal injection.</p><p>The 12-member jury had to be unanimous for Tsarnaev to get the death penalty. Otherwise, he would have automatically received a sentence of life in prison without parole.</p><p>Three people were killed and more than 260 wounded when two pressure-cooker bombs packed with shrapnel exploded near the finish line on April 15, 2013.</p><p>Tsarnaev was convicted last month of all 30 federal charges against him, including use of a weapon of mass destruction and the killing of an MIT police officer during the Tsarnaev brothers&#8217; getaway attempt. Seventeen of those charges carried the possibility of the death penalty.</p><p>Tsarnaev&#8217;s chief lawyer, death penalty specialist Judy Clarke, admitted at the very start of the trial that he participated in the bombings, bluntly telling the jury: &#8220;It was him.&#8221;</p><p>But the defense argued that Dzhokhar was an impressionable 19-year-old who was led astray by his volatile and domineering 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, who wanted to punish the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries.</p><p>Prosecutors portrayed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as an equal partner in the attack, saying he was so heartless he planted a bomb on the pavement behind a group of children, killing an 8-year-old boy.</p><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://gottliebgordon.com/7.html\"><strong>Robert Gottlieb</strong></a>, a former New York City prosecutor and longtime criminal defense attorney who has handled death penalty cases.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RoseannSdoiaRecoveryAndSupport\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Roseann Sdoia</strong></a>, survivor of the Boston Marathon bombing.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
