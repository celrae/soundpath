Only 15 percent of older workers feel that way.</p>\n<p>This week, the <a href=\"https://www.nfte.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship</a> (NFTE) brought a few dozen bright young entrepreneurs to Washington, D.C. for the educational organization’s annual gala. Many of the students (from the U.S. and abroad) planned or launched their businesses in high school. Here are a few of their pitches:</p>\n<p>“Most people don’t have the budget of a McDonald’s or a Folgers or a Kit Kat.

And yet: “The 20-to-34-year-old age cohort still has a far <a href=\"http://www.kauffman.org/~/media/kauffman_org/research%20reports%20and%20covers/2013/04/kiea_2013_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">lower percentage rate of entrepreneurship</a> than older cohorts, and that rate has actually fallen in the last couple of years.”</p>\n<p>Stangler offers at least one possible explanation: “No matter how badly you want to be an entrepreneur, no matter how low the cost of starting certain kinds of companies, if you come out of school with $60,000 in debt, entrepreneurship may not be as attractive an option.”</p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"http://www.up.edu/cfe/default.aspx?cid=5604&amp;pid=122\" target=\"_blank\">University of Portland</a>, business- and non-business majors participate in the school’s popular entrepreneurship program. Many students explore launching a startup during or after college, though the draw of more traditional paid work is strong, given the financial pressures recent graduates face.</p>\n<p>Eileen Kannengeiser is a political science and Spanish major, and hasn’t decided yet what she’ll do after graduation. “None of us wants to be living in a cardboard box after we graduate just to be able to pursue whatever we would like to pursue,” she says.</p>\n<p>History major Danielle Knott is jumping right in. She says like many young people, she needs a way to pay student debt and bills, and pursue her creative dreams. “I have a receptionist job, but I’m also starting a feminist food magazine,\" titled <a href=\"http://www.renderfoodmag.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Render\"</a>, says Knott. \"I definitely identify more as an entrepreneur. And I think a lot of liberal arts majors don’t understand that in the current job market, you have to be really entrepreneurial with your degree.&nbsp;And with things like Kickstarter, instead of trying to create the next Apple, people are being entrepreneurial about projects that they’re starting, to improve their quality of life instead of making them millions of dollars.”</p>\n<p>Marketing major Alex Gatewood says there’s the hype, and then the reality and sacrifice, of entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>“Being an entrepreneur has kind of become like our generation’s professional athlete or musician,” says Gatewood. “You know exactly who Mark Zuckerberg is. But what it takes to actually be that person? When it comes to paying the bills, those things just fall by the wayside.”</p>\n<p>This may be the generation that knows the most about entrepreneurs, but doesn’t have the wherewithal to actually join their ranks, at least not for a while.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Issues of entrepreneurship and first jobs aren't just illuminating for Millenials.
