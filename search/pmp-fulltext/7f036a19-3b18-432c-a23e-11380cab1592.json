Joined by our friend and librarian-in-chief Margaret Willison, we talk about the structure of the book, the character voices, Blume's particular brand of what Margaret calls \"emotional immediacy,\" the balancing of period references in a book set largely in the early 1950s, and lots more. I mention during this conversation that I got to talk to Judy Blume not long ago at an event in D.C.; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juP9tCb7cs4\" target=\"_blank\">you can actually watch it</a>, if you're interested.</p><p>We also talk about a new television show that <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2015/06/01/410601705/unreal-is-an-unsettling-look-at-making-unsettling-television\" target=\"_blank\">I wrote about</a> on the blog a while back: Lifetime's surprisingly thoughtful <em><a href=\"http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/unreal\" target=\"_blank\">UnREAL</a></em>, which is based on <a href=\"http://sequin-raze.squarespace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a short film</a> that's also really good. Stephen, Margaret and all come to <em>UnREAL </em>as experienced consumers of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2015/01/06/375385782/small-batch-the-bachelor-farms-iowa-for-fresh-meat\" target=\"_blank\">the franchise</a> it's most directly addressing, <em>The Bachelor </em>(and <em>Bachelorette</em>), while Glen ... does not. Whether that affects one's enjoyment of the show is just one of many questions tumbling around during this conversation.</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about binge-watching an old favorite with a young favorite, and he would like to take a moment to invite you to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/186913067/the-good-listener\" target=\"_blank\">pepper him</a> with questions about music. Glen is happy about Showtime's <em>Penny Dreadful</em>, and about the miniseries <em>Jonathan Strange And Mr. Norrell</em>, and about the video game he's been waiting for, <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>. Margaret is happy about <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/505516.Memoirs_of_a_Professional_Cad\" target=\"_blank\">an autobiography</a> she thought was out of reach that returned to her. And I am happy about <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Catastrophe/dp/B00X8UKEEQ\" target=\"_blank\">a TV series</a> that I'm only too happy to encourage you to enjoy.</p><p>Find us <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pchh\" target=\"_blank\">on Facebook</a> or follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nprpchh\" target=\"_blank\">the show</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nprmonkeysee\" target=\"_blank\">me</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/idislikestephen\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ghweldon\" target=\"_blank\">Glen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/MrsFridayNext\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret</a>, producer <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jessica_reedy\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica</a>, other producer <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/kianafitz\" target=\"_blank\">Kiana</a>, and pal and producer emeritus <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/mikekatzif\" target=\"_blank\">Mike</a>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
