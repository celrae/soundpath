At 21 years old, Gaskin is a member of both the St. Louis County NAACP and member of the NAACP National Board of Directors.</p><p>The NAACP event left people with a charge, engaged, and perhaps most importantly, with some answers and a place to vent, Gaskin said. He credits these factors for the decrease in violence across the St. Louis suburb.</p><p><div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"\">&#8220;It’s gonna be quite some time until residents in that community feel safe and feel like they can trust the officers.&#8221;</div></p><p>The area has been plagued with looting and rioting in the days following Brown&#8217;s death, as residents have taken out their anger about Brown&#8217;s killing.</p><p>&#8220;Although the NAACP may not be an organization that is standing on top of SUVs yelling, &#8216;No justice, no peace,&#8217; rest assured we are working for justice,&#8221; Gaskin said.</p><p>He is working with residents to explain the judicial process and to engage people both inside and outside the Ferguson community who would like to get involved constructively.</p><p>&#8220;Race had a lot to do with it,&#8221; Gaskin said of the police shooting. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a lot of police forces now, in today&#8217;s world, that are shooting first &#8212; multiple times &#8212; and asking questions later. &#8230; We are tired of continuing to hear about police brutality cases across the country.&#8221;</p><p>On July 17, Eric Garner, a New York City black man, died after an officer used an illegal chokehold while trying to arrest him for allegedly selling individual cigarettes.</p><p>And the one-year anniversary of the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of black 17-year-old Trayvon Martin recently passed.</p><p>&#8220;The list goes on and on. There&#8217;s cases of folks being killed by police that have not received national news,&#8221; Gaskin added.</p><p>Race is a factor that &#8220;absolutely&#8221; must be considered in Brown&#8217;s death, Gaskin said.</p><p>&#8220;The folks have to feel like they can trust the police. Right now that&#8217;s at an all-time low,&#8221; Gaskin said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s gonna be quite some time until residents in that community feel safe and feel like they can trust the officers.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.stlcountynaacp.org/?p=270\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>John Gaskin III</strong></a>, voting member of the NAACP <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/pages/naacp-board-of-directors\" target=\"_blank\">National Board of Directors</a> and member of <a href=\"http://www.stlcountynaacp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">St. Louis County NAACP</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
