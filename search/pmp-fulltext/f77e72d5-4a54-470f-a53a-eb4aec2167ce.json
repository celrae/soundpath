But it has also dredged up memories of the United States&#8217; long, fraught history with race and swimming pools.</p><p><strong>Yoni Appelbaum</strong> has been writing about this in The Atlantic, and joined <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young to discuss the history.</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;Pools have really been a site of racial and class conflict in America as long as they&#8217;ve been around.&#8221;</p><p></div></p><p>&#8220;Pools have really been a site of racial and class conflict in America as long as they&#8217;ve been around,&#8221; Appelbaum said. &#8220;By the 1920s, we started to redefine pools as social sites, as places of leisure and recreation. Men and women used them together, and that&#8217;s when most of the racial restrictions were imposed in the north, mirroring the segregation that already existed in the American South.&#8221;</p><p>Appelbaum said that in the decades that followed, desegregation did not come easily.</p><p>&#8220;When the courts start striking down segregation and forcing the integration of these pools, many communities simply get rid of them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They fill them in, they sell them off to private organizations. They&#8217;re not prepared to integrate the pools. Where the pools are successfully integrated, they&#8217;re integrated in name only. As black bathers enter the pools, white bathers leave.&#8221;</p><p>The gated community boom and the corresponding loss of public recreation facilities served to reinforce &#8220;the divides that are already there&#8221; between races and classes in American communities, Appelbaum said. It has also led to a loss of tax dollars and increased spending on homeowners association dues and private club memberships.</p><p>&#8220;Without the broad public support and broad public use that pools once had, it&#8217;s very hard for communities to build or maintain the kinds of facilities that once existed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The community fragments.&#8221;</p><p>McKinney, Texas, fits into this larger trend, Appelbaum said. The city has a predominantly white gated community population west of State Highway 75, and a less affluent population on the other.</p><p>&#8220;What young people in McKinney know is that the nice pools are not universally available to all the residents of the city,&#8221; he said.</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;The old tensions about the benefit of being able to define who does and does not belong in a community resurfaced at that moment.&#8221;</p><p></div></p><p>The events that unfolded in McKinney last Friday, Appelbaum said, were just another chapter in America&#8217;s long, complicated history with swimming pools.</p><p>&#8220;The old tensions about the benefit of being able to define who does and does not belong in a community resurfaced at that moment,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Appelbaum said his story for The Atlantic, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/troubled-waters-in-mckinney-texas/395150/\" target=\"_blank\">McKinney, Texas and the Racial History of American Swimming Pools</a>,&#8221; struck a familiar chord with many of his readers.</p><p>&#8220;What I found with adult readers of all races, there&#8217;s a memory of this time, whether they grew up in a small town where they weren&#8217;t mixing with children of other backgrounds, whether they grew up in a town where they were denied access to these sorts of facilities, or whether they grew up in a town which had integrated facilities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They look at the incident like the one that unfolded in McKinney and it reminds them both of how far we&#8217;ve come and how far we clearly have to go on these issues.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/author/yoni-appelbaum/\" target=\"_blank\">Yoni Appelbaum</a></strong>, a senior editor at The Atlantic, where he oversees the Politics section.
