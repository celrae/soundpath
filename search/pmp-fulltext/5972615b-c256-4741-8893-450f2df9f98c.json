And the elderly man was the China-born Dr. Richard Henke, who had more photos to share and more families to introduce.</p>\n<p>Ho, now a doctoral candidate in history at the University of Michigan, soon received more than 2,000 photos and a few hours of 16mm film dating back to the 1920s. The trove has become the basis of his doctoral thesis.</p>\n<p>\"The volume of images that missionaries were producing in China is extremely large,\" he says.

These photos show people at an outdoor market in Shanghai during the spring of 1949, before the Communist takeover.</p>\n<p>The shoppers are dressed in blue silk or cotton clothing and go about their business \"without a trace of panic in their faces.\" The photo also shows a little boy wearing a red sweater.  \"And I look at that picture and I wonder whether he's still alive today and what he would he say about that picture.\"</p>\n<p><em>CORRECTION: A previous version of this Incorrectly reported several details, including who Ho met, when that man was born and whether he was imprisoned in China as a child — he wasn't.
