But listen more closely, and stories begin to appear — stories that touch on greed, poverty and mental illness.</p><p>In writing two of the songs on <em>Painted</em> <em>Shut</em>,<em> </em>guitarist and vocalist<em> </em>Frances Quinlan took inspiration from the stories of two legendary musicians who suffered from schizophrenia, and whose lives remain something of a mystery. \"Buddy In The Parade\" focuses on early jazz cornet player Buddy Bolden, who was committed to an asylum and died in 1931. Quinlan learned that Bolden was buried in a poor man's cemetery in New Orleans, though nobody knows exactly where.</p><p>\"Horseshoe Crabs\" was inspired by Jackson C. Frank, a 1960s folk musician whose only album was produced by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15168166/paul-simon\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Simon</a>. Frank's songs were covered by artists like <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15242185/nick-drake\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Drake</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/98847896/simon-garfunkel\" target=\"_blank\">Simon & Garfunkel</a>, but his career never took off, and at one point he was homeless.</p><p>Given her muses, it's no wonder that Quinlan says that writing a song is an experience that's almost painful.</p><p>\"When you record something, it's forever,\" she says. \"And so you want it to be — I want it to be the best version of myself.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
