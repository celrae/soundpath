This is the latest in our <a href=\"https://hereandnow.wbur.org/tag/view-from-the-top\" target=\"_blank\">View From The Top</a> series of conversations.</p><h4>Interview Highlights: Joel Osteen</h4><p><strong>On Lakewood Church&#8217;s expansion</strong></p><p>&#8220;My dad started the church in 1959 with 90 people, and I grew up all my young years with 200 people or less in the church. I never really planned on having a big church, but around 1970,&#8217;72, something like that, the church started really growing. And then fast forward to when I took over in 1999 and it grew from 6,000 to many thousand. And I always tell people there are pros and cons to having big church. The cons are, I don&#8217;t know everybody like I used to. I used to go to all the ball games and stuff like that. The pros are, there&#8217;s something about when 10,000 people get together in a service. And also I think the programs we have to offer the people, like bigger companies have more to offer. You know it goes both ways, but the flip side is we didn&#8217;t want to turn people away. People kept coming and we thought, &#8216;OK, well let&#8217;s just build big a bigger place.'&#8221;</p><p><strong>On Lakewood&#8217;s approach to preaching</strong></p><p>&#8220;Our church is very diverse, as well, and my goal is to throw a wide net of hope to let people know that God is for them, he&#8217;s got a purpose for their life. And about half the people who watch and listen to us, they don&#8217;t consider themselves necessarily a religious people. They didn&#8217;t grow up in a church like me. That&#8217;s been my goal, how do we get outside the church wall, because that&#8217;s easy to keep talking to the same people, but I want to make God relevant to people who maybe weren&#8217;t raised like me.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the collision of politics and religion</strong></p><p>&#8220;I have friends who are very political. They&#8217;re pastors and that&#8217;s what their thing is. But I think sometimes, that the church world, we can take one issue and make it really, really big and it can turn people off where there are many bigger issues. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t like to be defined by one thing. You know our message is about lifting people up, helping them fulfill their destiny, helping them how to forgive in a tough time, how to make it through this life when life tries to push you down.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the decline of religion in America</strong></p><p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t like necessarily being associated with religion, with that connotation. Sometimes that means a certain thing politically, and it turns people off. &#8230; I believe faith in America is at an all-time high.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the church&#8217;s relationship with Muslims</strong></p><p>&#8220;I have Muslims that attend our church and my books sell a lot in Muslim countries as well. You know, I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t get too deep in those kinds of things, but our ministry is about reaching out to everybody, and so I do and I do have those conversations. I had a whole group of probably about 50 Muslims here at the service about two weeks ago, sitting right on the front row. They came, and we have good, good relations. And I think it&#8217;s again, part of our ministry is, you know, our main theme is Jesus says love God with all your heart and love your neighbor as you love yourself. And I don&#8217;t try to put people in a box &#8211; OK, they&#8217;re Jewish or they&#8217;re Catholic, they&#8217;re this or they&#8217;re that. I just say, &#8216;you know what, they&#8217;re somebody that God&#8217;s put in our path for us to love,&#8217; and that&#8217;s our philosophy.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On &#8216;the end of times&#8217;</strong></p><p>&#8220;I think in general the scripture talks abut how there&#8217;s earthquakes and famines and wars and you know you&#8217;re close to the end times. Well, we see a lot of that happening today. Does that mean a hundred years, a thousand years, or ten thousand years? Well, I don&#8217;t know. My thing is let&#8217;s make the most of this day. God&#8217;s given us this day and it&#8217;s a gift and we may not have tomorrow, but let&#8217;s be our best today and be a blessing to someone else and live it in vain.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.joelosteen.com/Pages/AboutJoel.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Joel Osteen</a></strong>, pastor of Lakewood Church.
