He says he's seen technology outpace the law countless times.</p><p>\"You design stuff to make it work and you don't think a lot about the legal and social consequences,\" says Froomkin. \"So by the time the lawyers get in the room, the standards are already baked and the stuff is already deployed.\"</p><p>The theme of the third-annual conference is risks and opportunities. Among Froomkin's favorite submissions were a paper on <a href=\"http://robots.law.miami.edu/2014/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Chief-Justice-John-Roberts-is-a-Robot-March-13-.pdf\">robots as judges</a> and another on <a href=\"http://robots.law.miami.edu/2014/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Bartow-We-Robot-2014.pdf\">gender issues</a> surrounding robotics.</p><p>In lectures and discussions, attendees are asking questions like: Do robots have rights? How hard could you shove the office robot that rolls over your foot? If a robot is reading your email, is that spying?</p><p>And, what laws will we need when drones start flying in the national airspace?</p><p>That <a href=\"http://robots.law.miami.edu/2014/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Beyer-Dulo-Townsley-and-Wu_Unmanned-Systems-Liability-and-Insurance-Trends_WE-ROBOT-2014-Conference.pdf\">last question</a> is on the mind of Donna Dulo, one of the presenters this year. Dulo is writing a law book for the American Bar Association about unmanned aviation.</p><p>\"Basically, we need to look at the safety of these systems. We need to look at the autonomy of the systems, and we need to be proactive with the laws,\" says Dulo, a senior mathematician and computer scientist with the Department of Defense. \"We don't want to wait 10, 15 years, or wait for a couple catastrophic accidents, before we get the law correct.\"</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration will officially allow commercial use of drones starting next year. The FAA has approved six commercial drone testing sites.</p><p>\"We're gonna see an exponential explosion of these aircraft in the skies in the near future â€” where news happens, where there's police incidents, where we're doing firefighting operations,\" Dulo says. \"Facebook wants to put these things in the sky to create a wireless cloud across the globe. Amazon wants to use them to deliver packages.\"</p><p>Dulo is concerned about the many unanswered questions raised by unmanned flying vehicles, including: how to prevent collisions, who bears responsibilities for accidents, and what kind of charges such accidents would bring.</p><p>She hopes that discussing these issues now will help as drones become more commonly used. As Dulo says, the drones are coming, whether we like it or not.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
