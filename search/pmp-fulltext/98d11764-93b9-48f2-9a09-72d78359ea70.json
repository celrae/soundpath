When she and the other bloggers saw people, not machines, making the clothing, it didn&#8217;t have an immediate impact.</p><p>&#8220;We thought that they were kind of used to it because they had been working in a factory for 14 years,&#8221; she told <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson.</p><p><strong>Anne Kari Garberg</strong>, who helped create the show admitted that this initial reaction was disappointing. Her motivation to create the show came from a want to help Norwegians understand the harsh reality of the less glamorous side of fashion.</p><p>&#8220;I watch a lot of televsion,&#8221; Garberg said. &#8220;I just saw several different shows where they would take Europeans and just expose them to poverty and the realities of developing countries. And I just started thinking that this is something we could do. We could open people&#8217;s eyes to the realities of garment workers by taking someone from Norway to experience that.&#8221;</p><p>Now that Ottesen is back in Norway, she said she&#8217;s stopped buying clothes in outlet stores. &#8220;I usually go to the markets, buying used clothes and vintage,&#8221; and she tries to get her friends to do the same.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.aftenposten.no/webtv/#!/kategori/10514/sweatshop-deadly-fashion\" target=\"_blank\">Watch the entire &#8220;Sweatshop&#8221; series</a></li></ul><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SCHfV97D7I\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Frida Ottesen</strong>, Norwegian fashion blogger and participant in the show &#8220;Sweatshop.&#8221;</li><li><strong>Anne Kari Garberg</strong>, researcher in the ethics department at i Framtiden i våre henders (the Future In Our Hands), and co-creator of the show &#8220;Sweatshop.&#8221; She tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/akgarberg\" target=\"_blank\">@akgarberg</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
