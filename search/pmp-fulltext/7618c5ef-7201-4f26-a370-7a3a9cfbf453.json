Veterinarians are a key player. They not only prescribe, but they sell most medications unlike most physicians for human drugs, and if your dog or cat dies as a result of a drug as a result of malpractice or abuse or neglect you’re not going to get anything out of it because most states say the dog’s worth is only replacement value, which is 50 or 100 dollars.”</p><p><strong>On the safety of the pet medication industry</strong></p><p>“A normal human drug, experimental drug that’s going through testing is often tested on 5,000 to 10,000 people from beginning to end, over what could end up being a decade for the whole development of the drug. Animal drugs are only tested on 200 or 300 cats or dogs, and they are often launched in a very quick time—five or six years compared to what it could take for a human drug to be developed.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>John Russell</strong>, investigative reporter for The Indianapolis Star.
