Kasper Hauser members Rob Baedeker and James and John Reichmuth join NPR's Robert Siegel to discuss some products that you can almost certainly live without.</p><hr /><h3>Interview Highlights</h3><p><strong>On their home improvement products, like the Cave Repainting Set and the Condo Pony</strong></p><p><strong>James Reichmuth:</strong> You may know what a terrible graffiti problem they had in the Pleistocene Era. And many of Europe's best caves have been defaced by stick figures. ... We have come up with a cave repainting set which just allows you, very handily and easily, to paint over these old caves and get them baby, room, or man-cave-ready. Folks, those horses are just doodles — lighten up.</p><p><strong>Rob Baedeker:</strong> Designer pets are all the rage these days. Ours is called the Condo Pony. It's a little horse that just kind of clomps around the condo. The motto is: <em>Condo doesn't have to mean no pony no more.</em></p><p><strong>On the Forever Diaper</strong></p><p><strong><strong>James </strong>Reichmuth:</strong> One of the things we're most excited about right now for new parents — and we worked with Russian scientists here, using blimp technology — is a — what we call — Forever Diaper. And that's a diaper that you put on at birth and it, technically, can stay on until early adolescence. We say: Let's take diapers off the table.</p><p><strong>On the Personality Alert Bracelet</strong></p><p><strong>Baedeker:</strong> Most of us get into relationships of many types and it takes a long time to figure out the other person's character flaws. So we've designed a personality alert bracelet. It lets first responders or first dates really know about your issues. Whether you are a narcissist ... a martyr ... a baby ... it just cuts to the chase and just makes things much more efficient.</p><p><strong><strong>James </strong>Reichmuth:</strong> I wear one of these. I'm wearing one now. It just says: Tuna makes me sleepy. ... It's just something that you want people that are close to you to know. So I wouldn't eat tuna before an interview, for example, and I did not.</p><p><strong>On SkyMall sometimes being funnier than SkyMaul</strong></p><p><strong><strong>James </strong>Reichmuth:</strong> It is hard to out-SkyMall SkyMall.</p><p><strong>Baedeker:</strong> Reality is a little bit ahead of us. ... It's that American tradition of giving you things you never knew you needed.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
