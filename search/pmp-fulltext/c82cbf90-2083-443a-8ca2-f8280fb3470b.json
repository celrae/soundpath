A trade group predicts another boom in sales this year.

The microchips are now used in cell phones, digital music players and even cars.\n<blockquote><strong>ROB ENDERLE:</strong> I don't think people realize how many microprocessors that a car consumes.

Even though demand is up, he says the makers of microprocessors have been forced to cut prices.\n<blockquote><strong>ENDERLE:</strong> Because there's so much competition here, prices continue to be reduced over time at a fairly aggressive pace.</blockquote>\nGood thing the Semiconductor Industry Association forecasts 10 percent growth for microchips this year. Enderle says companies will need to sell more products to compensate for shrinking profit margins.<br />\n<br />\nI'm Jeff Tyler for</div>","description":"A forecast out yesterday predicts double-digit growth for microchip sales by next year, but higher sales don't automatically translate into higher profits.
