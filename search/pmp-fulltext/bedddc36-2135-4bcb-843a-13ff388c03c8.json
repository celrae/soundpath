It’s called the page-turn reveal. So you’ve got to have a set up at the bottom of the right hand page, and you have to have a payoff at the top of the left hand page as they turn that page every time.

My father was killed in ‘99 and my mother died in 2009. I had to come to terms with how much of my performance was based on pleasing them and getting their approval and I had to find a way to motivate myself now that they were both gone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On the sense of loneliness that his characters have:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So many of us think that if we can get money enough, we can kind of isolate ourselves in the country or in the penthouse, then we will be happy because we won’t be dealing with Sartre’s “other people,” and then when we do achieve that isolation, we realize we’ve never been more unhappy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On the marketing of Fight Club 2:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve been really pulled into the whole creative, the whole enterprise.
