Brosseau's striking voice was first heard on NPR in 2006 — he performed a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/301796818/tom-brosseau-tiny-desk-concert\">Tiny Desk Concert of his own</a> last year — while Stark is a performer and a singer known to many as <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/173236646/lavender-diamond-heartbroken-but-happy\">Lavender Diamond</a>. Her voice fits in sweetly between Reilly's and Brosseau's in a way that recalls her work in the country trio <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/126220776/the-living-sisters\">The Living Sisters</a>. Rounding out this home-brewed acoustic affair is Andru Bemis on banjo and fiddle, as well as <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15403943/mike-doughty\">Soul Coughing</a>'s Sebastian Steinberg, who plays upright bass with finesse and humor.</p><p>So turn off the lights, blot out the distractions, light a candle or two, and let the glow — and the glow of your screen — transport you to country's past, when singers would all gather around a single mic. This is a band meant to play a Tiny Desk Concert.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"It's Never Too Late\"</li><li>\"Wayward Traveler\"</li><li>\"Rock Of Ages\"</li><li>\"Blues Stay Away From Me\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Maggie Starbard; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Morgan McCloy, Nick Michael, Maggie Starbard; Assistant Producer: Colin Marshall; photo by Colin Marshall/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
