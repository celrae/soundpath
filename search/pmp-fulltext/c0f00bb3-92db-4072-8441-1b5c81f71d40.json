His latest project, an album of mostly covers called <em>Tracks Of My Years</em>, includes his versions of songs by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/14951033/ray-charles\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Charles</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15131582/chuck-berry\" target=\"_blank\">Chuck Berry</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15193203/bob-dylan\" target=\"_blank\">Bob Dylan</a> â€” and a picture of a long-haired 15-year-old Adams, deep into hard rock. Still, he didn't end up covering the rock hits of his youth.</p><p>\"The idea of doing this album was difficult for me, because a lot of the songs that are out there that were inspiring to me as a youngster are untouchable,\" Adams tells NPR's Scott Simon. \"I couldn't do <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15396553/led-zeppelin\" target=\"_blank\">Led Zeppelin</a>'s 'Whole Lotta Love' or <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/91919509/deep-purple\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Purple</a>'s 'Smoke On The Water' or Steppenwolf's 'Born To Be Wild' or [The Beatles'] 'Hey Jude.' You know, there was no way. And so it was trying to find songs that I could do that suited my voice in a particular way.</p><p>That's how Adams ended up covering a different iconic song: \"God Only Knows,\" from <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15394818/the-beach-boys\" target=\"_blank\">The Beach Boys</a>' <em>Pet Sounds.</em></p><p>\"When I thought about doing The Beach Boys, of course, as much as I love 'em, there was no way I was gonna do the harmonies because I've never done records like that,\" he says. \"So I decided that I'd like to do this song, 'God Only Knows,' like <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15401855/bill-evans\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Evans</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15200004/tony-bennett\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Bennett</a>. It's a really, really incredible record. It's probably my favorite Tony Bennett record, and it just seemed like a nice approach to this song. 'Cause no one has ever done it like that before.\"</p><p>Hear the full conversation at the audio link.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
