Ukraine made gains in that area over the weekend; it's not known how many people might have died in Monday's attack.</p><p>The attack used both mortars and missiles, Ukraine says. The government held a news conference about the strike Monday; NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson says that so far, it's unknown how many casualties might have been caused. She also notes that a lack of corroborating evidence, such as video, is leading some to doubt the official account.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/18/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSKBN0GI0YK20140818\">Reuters</a> quotes military spokesman Anatoly Proshin:</p><p>\"A powerful artillery strike hit a refugee convoy near the area of Khryashchuvatye and Novosvitlivka. The force of the blow on the convoy was so strong that people were burned alive in the vehicles â€” they weren't able to get themselves out.\"</p><p>The agency also quotes Andrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic:</p><p>\"The Ukrainians themselves have bombed the road constantly with airplanes and Grads [missile launchers]. It seems they've now killed more civilians like they've been doing for months now. We don't have the ability to send Grads into that territory.\"</p><p>International observers say a humanitarian crisis is brewing in Luhansk, where around 250,000 people have been without power and water for weeks, Soraya says. The conditions have prompted thousands to leave the city.</p><p>More updates from Ukraine:</p><ul><li>A Russian convoy of more than 200 trucks carrying humanitarian aid remains halted outside of Ukraine's border.</li><li>The government says its forces moved deep into rebel-held Luhansk, but separatist fighters there also shot down a Ukrainian MiG 29 fighter jet this weekend.</li><li>In Donetsk, the other large city controlled by separatists, heavy fighting has cut off the water supply.</li><li>In Berlin, diplomatic talks between Ukraine and Russia, brokered by Germany and France, ended without a breakthrough.</li></ul><p>In a report for <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/\">Morning Edition</a> today, Soraya spoke with a separatist military commander in Donetsk who goes by the <em>nom de guerre</em> Vargan, a bearded man who's 41 years old.</p><p>\"Vargan says he was a conscript in the Soviet air force back in 1991,\" Soraya reports. \"He has a Ukrainian ID but calls himself a 'simple Russian soldier.' Nevertheless, killing Ukrainian soldiers makes him unhappy.\"<br /> <br />\"I don't want to fight against my brothers, and it is politicians who are making us do this,\" Vargan said of the violence.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
