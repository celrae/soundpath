Experts say European Jews have not felt this threatened since World War II, when some 6 million Jews were murdered in the Nazi Holocaust.</p><p>Researchers at Tel Aviv University monitoring anti-Semitism have reported a chilling increase in attacks in Europe over the past decade, including deadly shootings in Toulouse, France, in 2012 and Brussels last year. In recent years, France has had the highest number of incidents of any single country, and officials there say they will boost security at Jewish schools.</p><p><strong>Simone Rodan-Benzaquen</strong>, director of the American Jewish Committee&#8217;s Paris office, discusses the rising anti-Semitism in Europe with <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.ajc.org/site/c.fmJZKhOWJfI6G/b.8646041/k.677C/Simone_Rodan_Benzaquen.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Simone Rodan-Benzaquen</a></strong>, director of the American Jewish Committee&#8217;s Paris office.
