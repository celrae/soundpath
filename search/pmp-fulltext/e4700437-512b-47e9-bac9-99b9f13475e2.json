These views dovetail with the brothers’ corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States. And Greenpeace issued a report identifying the company as a &#8216;kingpin of climate science denial.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"WSJ Charles Koch\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303978304579475860515021286?cb=logged0.9630474378354847\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Wall Street Journal: </strong>Charles Koch: I&#8217;m Fighting to Restore a Free Society</a> &#8211; &#8220;A truly free society is based on a vision of respect for people and what they value. In a truly free society, any business that disrespects its customers will fail, and deserves to do so. The same should be true of any government that disrespects its citizens. The central belief and fatal conceit of the current administration is that you are incapable of running your own life, but those in power are capable of running it for you. This is the essence of big government and collectivism.&#8221;</p><h4>Watch A Trailer For &#8220;Citizen Koch&#8221;</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY4kJlIkjqw\">[Youtube]</a>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
