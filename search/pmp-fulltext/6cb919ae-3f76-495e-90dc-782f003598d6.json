Milan; addressing rallies; and posing with his 29-year-old girlfriend, Francesca Pascale — as well as hugging his white poodle Dudu.</p><p>The man, who while in office often boasted of his face-lifts and hair transplants, still wears pancake makeup and has a hair color and texture that do not exist in nature. The politician, who hosted \"bunga bunga\" sex parties with starlets, can be seen watching the Eurovision song contest on TV.</p><p>Sunday's vote will be the first big test of Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia Party since he finished serving a tax fraud conviction in March.</p><p>His passion, however, for the hustings seems long gone.</p><p>\"The court banned me from running for office for six years, and given my age, all I can do is campaign for other candidates and promote our great crusade,\" Berlusconi says.</p><p>His party broke off its agreement to back Prime Minister Renzi's constitutional reform program, and now, Berlusconi is campaigning like an outsider.</p><p>His party is polling at less than 12 percent, one-third of Renzi's center-left Democratic Party.</p><p>Barring last-minute surprises — perhaps thanks to Instagram — Italy could be witnessing the twilight of Berlusconi's political career.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
