The reason? Hundreds of thousands of pieces of space junk are circling the Earth at more than 17,000 miles per hour, posing a danger to the ISS and other space projects.","contentencoded":"<p>Space junk is a serious problem.</p>\n<p>There's lots of garbage orbiting our planet, everything from nuts and bolt to old satellites and used-up rocket stages. \"There are over 500,000 pieces of debris that are between the size of a cherry and a melon,\" says top space junk researcher Lucy Rogers of the <a href=\"http://www.bis-space.com/\">British Interplanetary Society</a>.</p>\n<p>And all of those bits of orbiting trash, even the small ones, can pose big problems. \"Something the size of a cherry going at 17,000 miles per hour — which it will be up in space — if that hits a spacecraft it can have the same effect as a hand grenade going off,\" she says.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-image_on_right\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/NASA-orbital-debris_FEATURE.jpg?itok=03CMXuvF\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Here are computer generated images of objects in Earth orbit that are currently being tracked.

That's what some Japanese researchers want to do.\n<p>They've made a special telescope that tracks debris from the International Space Station and want to pair it with a laser beam that would blast the garbage away — literally.</p>\n<p>\"The laser will focus on a piece of space debris and it will repeatedly hit it in bursts like a machine gun — wham wham wham wham!\" she says. That will heat the garbage and create little bursts of vaporized plasma that push the junk out into space like a thruster engine.</p>\n<p>But don't get too excited, Rogers says: This laser idea may not fly because of politics.</p>\n<p>\"If you can blast a piece of space debris, you can also blast someone else's satellite,\" she points out. \"And due to the '<a href=\"http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/abmtreaty\">Star Wars treaties</a>' ... putting a laser into space is causing political problems.\"</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-PIidaqCyU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-05-19%2Fastronauts-could-soon-be-blasting-space-junk-lasers&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/05192015_05.mp3"},{"href":"http://admin.pri.org/file/0519201505mp3"}]}
