It was very sad to see people trying to swim toward the ship to get on.”</p>\n<p>It was one of the last vessels that left before the city fell. The next day, the government of South Vietnam surrendered.</p>\n<p>The ship the Nguyens boarded had no destination, but they were about to be helped by a hastily organized rescue effort dubbed “Operation New Life.” It was a massive resettlement program for Vietnamese refugees organized by the US government, and it eventually brought more than 130,000 Vietnamese to America in the immediate aftemath of the war.</p>\n<p><em>See <a href=\"http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-04-24/photographer-catherine-karnow-captures-changing-vietnam\">photographs that show how Vietnam has changed</a> over the years.</em></p>\n<p>After arriving at a processing center in Guam, the Nguyens were given the choice of four arrival locations in the United States: California, Florida, Pennsylvania or Arkansas.

The Marines there were used to fighting and dying in Vietnam, but they didn’t know that would also have to help manage the war’s aftermath, says Faye Jonason, Camp Pendleton’s historian.</p>\n<p>“This is something they were not expecting,” Jonason says.</p>\n<p>The Marines were only given a few days' notice about the plans for the refugee camp. They hastily tried to build the camps from scratch, even going as far away as Utah to get extra tents, but they were overwhelmed by the number of people coming to the base.
