They say the brothers &#8212; Cherif and Said Kouachi &#8212; came out of their hideaway with guns blazing, and were killed in a shootout. It happened at a printing plant near the Charles de Gaulle airport.</p><p>The other hostage siege involved a man who police say was linked to the newspaper shooting suspects. A police union official says the gunman &#8212; who took at least five hostages at a kosher grocery in Paris &#8212; died in a raid at nearly the same time as the one that killed the brothers. According to one police official, three hostages also died at the grocery.</p><p>A police official had said that just minutes before the raid, the gunman at the kosher grocery had threatened to kill his five hostages if French authorities launched an assault on the two brothers.</p><p>Police believe the gunman at the grocery was also responsible for the roadside killing of a Paris policewoman yesterday.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/tag/charlie-hebdo-attack\" target=\"_blank\">See <em>Here & Now&#8217;</em>s full coverage of this story</a></li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Lauren Frayer</strong>, reports for NPR and the Los Angeles Times.
