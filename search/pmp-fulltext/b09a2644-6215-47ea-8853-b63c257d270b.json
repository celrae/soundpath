Willgoose, Esq.:</strong> And this is our dinner party soundtrack.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>The Walkmen – “The Rat”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>J. Willgoose, Esq.:</strong> The first track we would like to play is by The Walkmen, and it is called “The Rat.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/aWR1h-5EzUo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>J. Willgoose, Esq.:</strong> I like to give <em>incredibly awkward</em> dinner parties, where the music is totally inappropriate. So, I thought something really fast, with a hint of desperation and depression about it.&nbsp;I think one of the lyrics is, “when I used go out / I knew everyone&nbsp;I saw / Now I go out alone / if I go out at all.” [Laughs]</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Wrigglesworth:</strong> This is a <em>great</em> party.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>J. Willgoose, Esq.:</strong> I first heard it 11&nbsp;years ago on the radio, so&nbsp;I had to hurriedly write down the lyrics and then look it up on Google later when I got home, and I’ve loved this band ever since.&nbsp;What I really liked about The Walkmen was that they were no-nonsense. They didn’t have “band hair,” you know, they didn’t sort of…</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Wrigglesworth:</strong> You’ve definitely got band hair.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>J. Willgoose, Esq.:</strong> I <em>have not</em> got band hair.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Wrigglesworth:</strong> You <em>have</em> got band hair.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>J. Willgoose, Esq.:</strong> <em>You’ve</em> got&nbsp;band hair, if anyone has band hair. You’ve got big curly…</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Wrigglesworth:</strong> I don’t ever touch my hair!</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>J.

Willgoose, Esq.:</strong> The next song that we’ve chosen is David Bowie, and it is called… [mispronouncing the title] “Vashavah?” “Warsawah?” I never know how to say it. &nbsp;Which is a good reason for picking it, so I could embarrass myself in front of all these people at this dinner party.</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/9Gy94N_mcWs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>J. Willgoose, Esq.:</strong>&nbsp;It’s, I think, the first track on side B of “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001OH7W?tag=dinnerp-20\" target=\"_blank\">Low</a>” — one of the best albums ever made&nbsp;—&nbsp;and side B is just slightly out-there synth, mostly instrumental noodling. &nbsp;Which is just an extraordinary thing for one of the biggest pop acts of his time to do — nobody does that kind of thing anymore. Who does that now? You don’t see Madonna doing that.</p>\n<br />\n<p>I just love the unexpectedness of that sound, just coming in from nowhere. It’s just like, “I know what this track needs! It needs a great, big <em>HUMMM</em>.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Wrigglesworth:</strong> I’ve <em>left</em> by now.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>J. Willgoose, Esq.:</strong> Yeah. The party is definitely not going <em>quite</em> to plan.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Wrigglesworth:</strong> You’ve probably burnt the chicken I prepared for you as well.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>J.
