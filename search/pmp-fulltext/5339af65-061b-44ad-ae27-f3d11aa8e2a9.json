They have no function.\"</p><p>To see what might be significant, they reviewed what was already known about each gene. They found one gene that was intriguing.</p><p>\"Based on what we know in humans and mice, it had three functions,\" says Lynch. \"It functions in sensing the external temperature. It functions in fat biology. And it functions in regulating hair growth.\"</p><p>Previous studies had shown that when you disable this gene in mice, says Lunch, \"they actually prefer to live in colder environments.\"</p><p>The scientists did some lab experiments to see if the mammoth-specific genetic change actually did anything potentially meaningful. And it did — it turned down the activity of the protein produced by the gene.</p><p>\"My perception of what's novel in the paper, as compared with other ancient genome papers (and indeed most extant-genome papers) is that we go beyond simply running computer programs and reporting the results; we make computational predictions and verify them with laboratory experiments,\" Miller told NPR in an email.</p><p>But could you use this information to help re-create a woolly mammoth?</p><p>\"I have no interest in 'de-extinction' of the mammoth,\" says Miller.</p><p>Neither does Lynch.</p><p>\"You could change this one gene in an elephant and maybe make it woolly mammoth-like with respect to some things,\" Lynch says. But to claim you'd re-created a mammoth, he thinks you'd need to make millions of changes to the Asian elephant's DNA. You'd have to put in every mammoth-specific change, plus take away everything that's unique to Asian elephants.</p><p>\"And even then it's not really a woolly mammoth,\" he says. \"It's a transmutated Asian elephant. You can never actually bring back a woolly mammoth.\"</p><p>Lynch thinks scientists shouldn't try — that it would be unethical. \"Elephants are intelligent species. They have complex social groups. They learn from each other,\" he notes. \"So if we bring back a woolly mammoth, who's it going to learn how to be a woolly mammoth from?\"</p><p>\"They're gone,\" Lynch says. \"And who are we to bring it back?\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
