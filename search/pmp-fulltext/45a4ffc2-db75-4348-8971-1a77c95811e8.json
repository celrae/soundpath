He chose the banana plant for a reason. Both his father and his grandfather worked on banana plantations in Honduras.

One is called a branch drain system, like Lizama's. It takes water from your shower drain. The other is called a laundry-to-landscape. It sends water from your washing machine to your yard.

He recently had a greywater system in his own home by <a title=\"Enviromeasures\" href=\"http://enviromeasures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Enviromeasures--</a>a local company that works with homeowners to install gray water systems. Graham explained the restrictions. \"You have to use it within 24 hours, you can't store it on site, and when you put it in the landscape it can't be in the air.\"</p>\n<p>In other words, no tanks or barrels and no sprinklers. The water is dispersed directly through mulch or pebbles. These simple systems won't work on a typical grass lawn. To use greywater on those, you'd have to install a more complicated system. But Wade Graham's yard is not typical. \"I have a weakness for aloe, so I've go about 50 species of aloe.\"</p>\n<p>Graham's house sits on a hill and his front yard is so steep, you have to zig-zag up a walkway to get to his front door. The path is lined with citrus trees, bay laurel hedges and California meadow sedge, a grass that responds well to sub-surface irrigation.</p>\n<p>Graham walked me to a narrow hallway at the back of the house with a washer and dryer, to show me how the system works. He lifts the lid of his washing machine. \"Just so happened to need to do a load,\" he said as he pulled a jug of laundry detergent down from a shelf.</p>\n<p>Greywater is perfectly safe for landscaping and gardening as long as you use plant-based soaps and detergents. \"This is coconut oil based and it turns out to be much nicer in your skin and everything,\" says Graham.</p>\n<p>The water from this load of laundry will travel through pipes and make its way here to the front yard. Once the laundry got going we walked to the front of the house, where Graham lifted a ceramic tile from his yard. We stood above a small hole in the ground and wait with anticipation.
