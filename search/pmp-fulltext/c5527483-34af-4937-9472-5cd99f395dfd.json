Rather than isolating her, it has given her a unique sensitivity and connection to her music. She's the subject of the documentary <em>Touch the Sound</em>, which explores her unconventional approach to percussion.</p><p>In addition to her solo career, Glennie has collaborated with musicians ranging from classical orchestras to Björk. She's performed in concert halls around the world, and she's recorded a dozen albums, winning a Grammy for her recording of Bartók's \"Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion,\" and another for her 2002 collaboration with Bela Fleck. This year along with Emmylou Harris, she was the recipient of the prestigious Polar Music Prize.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
