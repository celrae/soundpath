But recently, he's been reaching beyond that realm.</p>\n<p>Watt has teamed up with two Italian musicians 20 years younger to do something new. And that, he says, helps keeps him in \"student mode.\"</p>\n<p>He enlisted drummer Andrea Belfi and guitarist Stefano Pilia for his latest project, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19651-mike-watt-il-sogno-del-marinaio-canto-secondo/\">Il Sogno del Marinaio</a>.
