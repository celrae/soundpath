Cut the dates, lengthwise, into very thin strips, and place in a small separate bowl. Peel the celery stalks and cut it in half lengthwise. With your knife at a diagonal angle, cut very thin, 1- to 2-inch pieces of celery. Add to the dates. Slice the sides off the apple and cut those pieces into very thin slices. Squeeze lemon juice over the apple slices, to keep them from browning.</p><p>In a small bowl, make the dressing by whisking together the vinegar, maple syrup, and olive oil. Season with 2 pinches of salt and a few grind of pepper.</p><p>Just before serving, pour most of the dressing over the salad and toss to combine; pour the rest over the celery and dates. Top with the celery, dates, apple slices, walnuts and feta cheese.</p><p><em>*Cook’s Note: Some feta cheese has little flavor, surprisingly. But the French sheep’s milk feta is usually flavorful, as is the Greek feta that is a combination of sheep and goat’s milk.</em></p><p><em>Excerpted from Kale, Glorious Kale © 2014 by Catherine Walthers.
