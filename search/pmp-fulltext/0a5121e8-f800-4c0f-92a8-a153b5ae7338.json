The changing demographics will significantly impact the governor's race.","itags":["npr_api","354887562"],"contentencoded":"<p>The Cuban vote in South Florida isn&#8217;t as monolithic as it once was.</p><p>Younger Cuban Americans don&#8217;t always share their parents&#8217; conservative opinions about American foreign policy.</p><p>Besides, Miami’s Latino community is diversifying. Go to Little Havana these days, and you&#8217;re just as likely to see new  immigrants from Venezuela and Colombia as old time Cubans.</p><p>The diversifying make up is also apparent in the governor&#8217;s race. Incumbent governor Rick Scott has picked a Cuban-American named Carlos Lopez Cantera as his running mate, while Democratic challenger (and former Republican governor) Charlie Crist has chosen a Colombian-American named Annette Taddeo-Goldstein.</p><p>In November, Latino voters will play a big role in determining the state&#8217;s next governor, but they’re notoriously difficult to bring out to the polls.</p><p><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org\"><em>Here & Now&#8217;</em></a>s Jeremy Hobson visited Little Havana on Calle Ocho, where many older Cubans still gather at a park to play dominoes. He met Fernando Gonzales, who came to the US in the 1960s.</p><p>&#8220;I never believe that the Democratic party is doing the right thing to this country,&#8221; Gonzales says.</p><p>You won’t be surprised to hear that he is voting for Rick Scott next month.</p><p>&#8220;I know that he has some problems, but everybody has problems.&#8221; Gonzales says. &#8220;When I vote for him, I vote for [the party of] Martin Luther King and Abraham Lincoln.&#8221;</p><p>But that view is not representative of today’s Florida Hispanic voters says Guillermo Grenier, a sociology professor in the department of global and social cultural studies at Florida International University.</p><p>&#8220;You have about 25 percent Democrat, 20 percent independent right now,&#8221; he says. &#8220;What you see is a younger generation of second and third generation Cuban-Americans that are more incorporated into the political environment of the United States.&#8221;</p><p>Grenier adds that most of the Cubans in Miami have recently arrived, not those who came during Fidel Castro&#8217;s repressive rule.</p><p>&#8220;35 percent of the Cubans in Miami-Dade Coutny right now came after 1995,&#8221; Grenier says. &#8220;That is the cohort that is growing. The new Cubans. They dont&#8217; have the same memory of Cuba, they don&#8217;t have the same reasons for leaving. And when they get here, their concerns are different.&#8221;</p><p>Grenier says even little Havana is &#8220;an imagined place for Cuba.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;In the real lived community here, Cubans are about 30 percent of the population,&#8221; he said.</p><p>Nicaraguans, Mexicans, Hondurans and Guatemalans make up significant proportions of the Hispanic population in Miami.</p><p>Alvaro Fernandez spends plenty of time talking to people on Calle Ocho and other streets around Miami. He tries to get Hispanic voters registered for the Miami Progressive Project.</p><p>&#8220;I would say this area is still a Republican area,&#8221; Fernandez says. &#8220;But you are starting to see in this area the change more toward the middle.&#8221;</p><p>He says Latino voters&#8217; main issue is not immigration.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s jobs,&#8221; Fernandez says. &#8220;They are becoming Americanized, they have the same issues as everyone else: the economy, the economy, the economy.&#8221;</p><p>Fernandez predicts, though, that Hispanic voters will have very low turnout at the coming governor&#8217;s election.</p><p>&#8220;They just feel neither party will help them,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They say, &#8216;Why waste my time? I&#8217;d rather be working, helping my family, than voting.&#8217;&#8221;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
