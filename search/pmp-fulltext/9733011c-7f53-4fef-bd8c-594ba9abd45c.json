He was, the newspaper says, \"one of music's sweetest voices and most incisive songwriters.\" It adds that:</p><p><blockquote></p><p>\"The mellifluous-voiced author of 'The Brand New Tennessee Waltz,' 'Mississippi, You're on My Mind' and 'Biloxi,' the Memphis-raised Winchester had long been a favorite of critics and fellow musicians, covered by a wide array of artists from Wilson Pickett to the Everly Brothers, Jerry Garcia to Reba McEntire. Bob Dylan was famously quoted as saying of Mr. Winchester: 'You can't talk about the best songwriters and not include him.' In 2007, Mr. Winchester was recognized with a Lifetime Achievement Award from performing rights organization ASCAP for his body of work.\"</p><p></blockquote></p><p>The<em> Commercial Appeal</em> reports it learned of Winchester's death from the singer-songwriter's wife, Cindy Winchester.</p><p>Last November, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/246001072/jesse-winchester-on-mountain-stage\" target=\"_blank\">NPR Music posted a Mountain Stage performance</a> by Winchester.

Winchester released seven albums in the 1970s and early '80s, culminating with the Top 40 hit 'Say What' in 1981.\"</p><p></blockquote></p><p>Winchester, like hundreds of thousands of other anti-war protesters who left the country or otherwise avoided the draft, was able to return to the U.S. after <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0108/7974.html\" target=\"_blank\">President Carter granted them unconditional pardons</a> on his first day in office â€” Jan. 21, 1977.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
