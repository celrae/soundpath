But I certainly don't want a zero-state solution, where Israel's very existence would be jeopardized,\" Netanyahu says.</p><p>In the final days of campaigning, Netanyahu said there would be no Palestinian state if he were re-elected to another term. He said the current situation in the region meant that Israel evacuating land would give Islamist extremists a launching pad for attacks on Israel.</p><p>Netanyahu's statement was widely read as him ruling out the possibility of a Palestinian state altogether, a position advocated by a right-wing political rival who is popular among Israeli settlers living in the West Bank.</p><p>In a separate interview on <em>Morning Edition</em>, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accuses Netanyahu of \"exporting fear\" to Israelis and of being disingenuous about a Palestinian state.</p><p>\"In my opinion, this man was never a two-stater,\" Erekat says.</p><p>Erekat, who is also a member of the essentially defunct Palestinian parliament, also warns of possible violence if Israel does not change its stance on settlements in Palestinian territories.</p><p>Netanyahu \"is seeking to have the status quo of one state, two systems and this will lead straight into violence and bloodshed. And that's what we should avoid,\" Erekat says.</p><p>\"I am warning; I am not threatening,\" he adds. \"I don't want my son to be a suicide bomber. I don't want my son to be killed.\"</p><p>Thursday's interview with Netanyahu comes amid <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2015/03/18/393839692/bad-blood-gets-worse-between-barack-bibi-and-israel\">strained relations with the White House</a> after the Israeli leader accepted an invitation from House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to address Congress on March 3. The prime minister used the platform to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/03/03/390250986/netanyahu-to-outline-iran-threats-in-much-anticipated-speech-to-congress\">air his differences</a> with the Obama administration's approach to ongoing negotiations on Iran's nuclear program.</p><p>Netanyahu says he wants to make it clear \"that I am the prime minister of all Israeli citizens.\" But he insists that no movement is possible unless the Palestinian Authority is \"ready to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27142594\">break the pact with Hamas.\"</a></p><p>Asked about the composition of his emerging post-election coalition, Netanyahu says he's \"starting with the decision that the voters have made, which is very clearly to seek a coalition with the parties of what are called the National Camp.\"</p><p>Asked how long it might take, the Israeli prime minister says: \"A few weeks, but you'll have to be patient with us. It's like Noah's Ark â€” 40 days and 40 nights.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
