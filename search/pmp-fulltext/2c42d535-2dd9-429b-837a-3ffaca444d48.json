I’m not one of those, you know, you know that whole idea of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy running around, like getting people’s mullets removed and smartening them up, I’m not that person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico <strong>Gagliano</strong>:</strong> No.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> Like, I’m not one of those people that wants everyone to look like pretty and the same. I would rather people look demented.</p>\n<br />\n<p>So keeping that in mind Liz, I would say here’s what you do. Yes, you buy the same shirt, and everything that she buys you buy. And then it becomes, it becomes like a performance art thing-</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I love it.<a href=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SD_32.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"Simon Doonan photographed by Todd Oldham - simondoonan.com\" src=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SD_32-300x300.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico <strong>Gagliano</strong>:</strong> That’s true.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> -where you’re like Gilbert and George, and you’re like “G<em>asp</em>, there’s that girl who everything I buy she buys.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Yeah I like it.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico <strong>Gagliano</strong>:</strong> What if you just picked a stranger and started doing that? Not your friend.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> I think it’s a genius thing to do, like, and then other people might see you and start doing it to you, and before you know it, there’d be a whole flash mob of people wearing the same shirt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico&nbsp;</strong>Gagliano: That’s art for sure.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> So yes, yes, yes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<h2>Repress or release your inner DJ?</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> All right. There you go Liz. This next question comes from M.A., and it was sent to us via Facebook and the question is, “When you’re in a party and the music is terrible, is it okay to tell the host to change it, or do you just pour your drink on the sound system and pretend you actually spilled it, then offer your iPhone music collection instead?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> Well, M.A., keep in mind that terrible is a subjective term, like one person’s punk rock is another person’s lounge music. You know what I mean? Not- we all have different taste.</p>\n<br />\n<p>But if you’re really having a rough time with the music the host’s playing, the key is to start dancing in a very strange way, sort of like you’re having a voodoo freak-out, and not in time to the music, but enough that it creates some kind of discomfort among the other guests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Oh I see where you’re going, yeah.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> And because you’re responding to it in such a creepy, deranged kind of way, they will change the music.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I like that.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico <strong>Gagliano</strong>:</strong> They should, that’s the fashionable thing, not necessarily the most social thing to do, but certainly you’ll get your way.</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Every girl is crazy ’bout a sharp dressed man</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Galiano:&nbsp;</strong>All right, this is from Robert in El Paso, Texas. Robert writes, “I’m attending a civilian wedding soon. Is it appropriate to wear my military dress uniform? I’ve heard it’s only okay to show up in uniform if the groom is wearing one, but there’s also conflicting advice that it’s what we always should wear to black tie events, as it is our equivalent of a tuxedo.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> 100% wear your military uniform, for many reasons, like you should be proud of it. A uniform is infinitely more interesting than a tuxedo, just from a purely objective point of view, and secondly, is there anything more boring than a wedding?</p>\n<br />\n<p>I mean, weddings are the ultimate snore, and you turning up in your military outfit, you know, people are gonna want to chat to you, you can tell your stories, your experience, so yes, yes, yes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Let’s spice it up.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> And pile on the medals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Now I have a question, what if Liz is Robert’s friend? Should she wear a uniform too?<a href=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SD_37.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"Simon Doonan - simondoonan.com\" src=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SD_37-204x300.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico <strong>Gagliano</strong>:</strong> Oh, there you go.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> Oh that would be hot. That would be so hot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<h2>Pose it like Posh</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico <strong>Gagliano</strong>:</strong> All right, here is a final question. This comes from Jana in West Chicago, Illinois.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Jana writes, “I have just returned from a trip to Paris with three girlfriends. Among other things, we visited the catacombs below Paris. Six million bodies were relocated there from other cemeteries around the city, pictures are allowed but without flash photography.</p>\n<br />\n<p>What the heck do you do when you are having your picture taken in front of a wall of bones? Do you smile? Do you not smile? Should you not take any pictures at all? #catacombsetiquetteproblems.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> This is a common problem.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> I think you do a Victoria Beckham. You know, she’s very committed to not smiling when people take her picture. So when you’re in a catacomb, you just think what would Victoria do, and you do that face. It’s like a sort of girl’s version of a Zoolander face. I think that works at the catacombs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico <strong>Gagliano</strong>:</strong> I would like to go online and see like what other people are doing. That would be a good Tumblr page I think, with just photos in front of the wall of bones.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Well, do you need a picture is part of my question? Can you just remember what it was like down there?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> Well apparently, I mean, people just relentlessly document everything don’t they, to a degree that I find quite dizzying and incomprehensible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico <strong>Gagliano</strong>:</strong> But a wall of bones, that’s a rare thing. I mean, I kind of want some kind of souvenir, and I don’t think you can take a bone.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> I’m sure there’s a lovely postcard in the shop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Exactly, exactly.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> That’s what people used to do. Oh, let’s go to the shop and buy a postcard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Postcard makers were the early Instagrammers. Simon Doonan, thanks for coming on and telling our audience how to behave.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Simon Doonan:</strong> Oh, my pleasure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br /></div>","published":"2013-09-06T23:04:26+00:00","teaser":"From making displays for Barneys New York store windows to being their Creative-Ambassador-at-Large – not to mention an author, television personality, global gadfly, and half of the reigning power couple in American retail – Simon Doonan has flown up the ranks of the fashion world and loved every kooky minute of it.
