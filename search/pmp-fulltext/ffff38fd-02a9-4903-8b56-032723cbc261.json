Huerta told a House panel \"the system is safe,\" despite a Government Accountability Office report that found \"significant security control weaknesses.\"</p><p>Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore, one of the lawmakers who requested the GAO report, said at a House Transportation subcommittee hearing that he is concerned the system could be vulnerable to breach by terrorists. \"We know there is an enduring interest in terrorist groups in aviation; they've used our aviation system as weapons. One can imagine they might be interested in hacking the system and perhaps could facilitate a midair collision.\"</p><p>The GAO report found the FAA has taken steps to protect air traffic control systems, but that weaknesses remain in, among other things:</p><ul><li>controlling, preventing, and detecting unauthorized access to computer resources</li></ul><ul><li>identifying and authenticating users</li></ul><ul><li>encrypting sensitive data</li></ul><p>Huerta told the panel that \"first and foremost, the system is safe.\" He said a significant number of the GAO report's recommendations have been \"remediated already.\"</p><p>The air traffic control system is operated by more than 46,000 FAA personnel and handles as many as 2,850 flights in a given moment. The GAO report found the FAA has \"not fully established an integrated, organization-wide approach to managing information security risk that is aligned with its mission.\"</p><p>Therefore, the report says, air traffic control systems are at \"increased and unnecessary risk of unauthorized access, use or modification\" that could disrupt air traffic control operations.</p><p>Most of the report's findings are classified.</p><p>Huerta said the FAA had previously established a cybersecurity steering committee and said he is \"very actively focused\" on the GAO's recommendations.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
