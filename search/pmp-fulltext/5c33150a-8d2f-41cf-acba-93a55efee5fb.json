Part of that is redefining masculinity, so the show asked me to ask guys about the stuff they equate with manliness today. (Submit your own stories in the <a href=\"#form\">form below</a>.)</p><p>I started my very unscientific investigation on a Friday night at a Washington, D.C., barbershop. Fresh Cut owner Bernard Fernandez chose his Buick. He fixed it up himself and says that first car meant freedom and independence; a way to get to and from work and a paycheck. \"That's manly!\" Fernandez says.</p><p>\"It didn't have nothing but one seat in it, that was the driver's seat — anybody else rode in it, they just rode on milk crates. I had a lot of fun in that car.\"</p><p>When I asked on Twitter, one of you picked a BabyBjorn as your object because you tweeted that you didn't feel like a man until you had a kid. Others mentioned motorcycles, chainsaws and even a \"man pan\" (that's a heavy cast iron pan for those who are curious; I know I was).</p><p>When I posed the question to writer and rapper David Lee, he immediately thought of what he <em>should say.</em></p><p>\"I should pick something like a watch or a boot, perhaps a battle-ax,\" he says.</p><p>Lee is a New Yorker who writes <a href=\"http://gumship.com/\">Gumship</a>, an online men's guide to Asian lifestyle and entertainment. He ultimately voted against the battle-ax and went with a bathrobe as his masculine object. But his is no Hugh Heffner-esque robe. The blue terry cloth <em>Adventure Time </em>cartoon robe hits around midthigh, and Lee says it represents the luxury of being a man today.</p><p>\"I think we're at a space in time where men are openly loving My Little Ponies, embracing cartoons, still playing video games, and we're really dictating what it means to be a man,\" he says. \"Everyone's confused whether or not they're being ironic or not, and that's so luxurious, you know?\"</p><p><a name=\"form\"></a>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
