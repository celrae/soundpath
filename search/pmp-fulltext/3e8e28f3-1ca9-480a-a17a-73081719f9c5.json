Morgan and her sister, Caitria, found <a href=\"https://recovers.org/\">Recovers.org</a> after a tornado leveled their hometown. Working as lead volunteer coordinators, the two created a flexible framework for an \"unofficial\" community response. Caitria and Morgan have translated their system into software for local coordinators, through Recovers.org. Their system can be rolled out quickly, helping local relief organizers turn interest into action.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
