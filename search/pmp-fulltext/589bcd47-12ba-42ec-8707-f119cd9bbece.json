Here are the critical issue that will need to be resolved.","itags":["npr_api","348903293"],"guid":"589bcd47-12ba-42ec-8707-f119cd9bbece","contentencoded":"<p><em>Editor's Note: This story was updated from its original version on Nov. 23,  ahead of the upcoming expiration of the agreement limiting Iran's nuclear program.</em></p><p>The temporary agreement limiting Iran's nuclear program expires on Monday. That deal brought Iran some relief from international economic sanctions in return for freezing much of its nuclear program and allowing unprecedented monitoring of its nuclear activities. As the clock runs down, negotiators from Iran and six world powers in Vienna are working down to the wire for a longer-term deal.</p><p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is personally engaged in the talks, as is his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif. Analysts say the pressure has increased after the U.S. midterm elections handed the Senate to Republicans, some of whom say Iran can't be trusted and are considering toughening sanctions. Such a move could prompt Iranian hardliners, including the country's clerical leadership, to force Iran to step away from the talks.</p><p>The thorniest issues remain unresolved. They include Iran's ability to produce nuclear fuel and the West's willingness to lift sanctions against Iran. If the parties can't get a deal by Monday, they could potentially extend the current deal and set a new deadline, though that could strengthen opposition to a deal both in the U.S. and Iran.</p><p>Here are the major sticking points:</p><p><strong>1. Centrifuges And Uranium Enrichment</strong></p><p>Iran has about 19,000 centrifuges capable of enriching uranium for nuclear energy, medical research â€” or nuclear weapons fuel. Of those, fewer than 10,000 are currently spinning, all relatively inefficient \"first generation\" models.</p><p>Tehran has already won a major concession from the international side, which acknowledged last November that Iran would be permitted to keep some form of uranium enrichment program. Now the questions are how big should it be, and how long should it be under international restriction?</p><p>Recent but unconfirmed reports suggest that Washington might accept as many as 4,000 centrifuges, while Iran could live with 8,000 or so. The number is important, but so are other variables, such as what Iran does with the fuel those centrifuges produce. One option would be to ship it elsewhere, possibly Russia, which is providing fuel for Iran's only nuclear reactor, at Bushehr.</p><p>Another factor is how transparent the program is. U.N. nuclear inspectors currently have unprecedented access to Iran's main nuclear facilities; for the West, the greater the access those inspectors have, the more confidence the world can have that Iran's nuclear program is as peaceful as it has always claimed.</p><p><strong>2. Sanctions</strong></p><p>For Iran, getting international sanctions lifted is the main incentive for negotiating limits on its nuclear program. The Iranian economy has been battered by economic strictures on its oil and gas and banking sectors.</p><p>The problem for the West is that, as analyst Ali Vaez at the International Crisis Group has argued, turning sanctions on and off is a very tricky prospect. Some sanctions are controlled by the U.N., some by the White House, some by the U.S. Congress, and some by the European Union. Congress in particular has shown reluctance to lift sanctions, and could conceivably impose new ones whether or not an agreement is reached in the coming days.</p><p><strong>3. Arak Heavy Water Reactor</strong></p><p>This still-incomplete heavy water facility near the city of Arak has been dubbed the \"plutonium pathway\" to a nuclear weapon, because while it runs on raw uranium, it produces plutonium. This is precisely how a number of nuclear weapons states got their start. The West initially hoped Iran would offer to scrap the plant, but Tehran declared Arak one of its \"red lines\" that must be respected. Western and Iranian officials have suggested, however, that it might be acceptable to modify the reactor so it produces much less plutonium. In addition, Iran currently has no reprocessing plant to convert plutonium to weapons fuel, and it could agree not to build one as part of a nuclear deal.</p><p><strong>4. Fordow Underground Enrichment Facility</strong></p><p>The 2009 announcement that Iran had a secret uranium enrichment plant at Fordow, deep beneath a mountain not far from the holy city of Qom, sent shock waves through Israel and Western powers.</p><p>Iran insists it wasn't required to reveal the site's existence to the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, any earlier, but the bunkered facility fueled suspicions that Tehran was keeping the nuclear weapons option open.</p><p><strong>5. Possible Military Dimensions, Or PMDs</strong></p><p>This has been primarily an issue for the IAEA, which has several questions about past Iranian research and experiments that appear to have been part of weapons research.</p><p>Iran insists there are peaceful explanations for all the questions but has been reluctant to provide them, insisting this issue should be dealt with later. Experts say it's very likely Tehran did have a weapons program dating back to the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.</p><p>Former IAEA director Robert Kelley says, \"I have said many times I believe there probably was one, particularly when Saddam Hussein was the number one enemy. And I think it's sad that Iran has not found some political way to explain what they've done in the past.\"</p><p><strong>6. Monitoring And Verification</strong></p><p>This also involves the IAEA and will be a huge component of any nuclear deal. Iran is being asked to agree to unprecedented levels of intrusive inspections and monitoring of its nuclear program. And for every concession the P5+1 grants to Tehran allowing a larger program, the more transparency it will demand in return.</p><p>Analyst and former U.S. nuclear negotiator <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/%7E/media/research/files/papers/2014/03/31%20nuclear%20armed%20iran%20einhorn/31%20nuclear%20armed%20iran%20einhorn%20pdf.pdf\">Robert Einhorn has written</a> that the IAEA will \"require monitoring authorities and procedures not ... found in any existing safeguards agreements,\" powers that \"go well beyond those contained in the (so-called) Additional Protocols,\" currently the strongest verification regime used by the agency.</p><p>Iran insists that it must be treated like any other nuclear energy state, and is demanding that any additional monitoring be for a limited time only.</p><p><strong>7. Mistrust And Suspicion</strong></p><p>Although not on the list of nuclear sticking points, overcoming decades of mistrust will be essential if a comprehensive nuclear agreement is to succeed. American, Israeli and Gulf Arab hard-liners believe that no matter what Tehran says, it will never give up its nuclear weapons ambitions.</p><p>Iran's hard-liners, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, are convinced that Washington will never be satisfied with an entirely peaceful Iranian nuclear program but will press to topple the Islamic Republic.</p><p>In response to such entrenched suspicions, supporters of nuclear diplomacy say, consider the alternative. If there is no agreement, they say, there will be some immediate results, all negative: The U.S. Congress will likely rush to enact even more sanctions on Iran, driving it further into isolation. The unprecedented international sanctions regime that brought Iran to the negotiating table may begin to crumble, starting with Russia. And the most pragmatic and engaging figure in Iranian politics in years, President Hassan Rouhani, will be greatly weakened.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
