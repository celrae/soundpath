His boots are all battered, worn down at the heels, and he's dozing off. The album's title kind of says it all: <em>The No-Hit Wonder</em>. It's his fourth in a career stacked with lonesome country anthems to life on the road, delivered in a voice that's pleasantly weathered.</p><p>In an interview with NPR's Melissa Block, Branan says that while his style of music hasn't produced many hitmakers, he's content playing a smaller game. It's a lesson he learned in part through his years as a bartender.</p><p>\"A lot of music is like the fruity shooters — you know, the Top 40 songs of the week,\" he says. \"And that's great! You know, my music doesn't go very well with a bachelorette party; somebody's music needs to do that.</p><p>\"Roots music is a little more like a bourbon,\" Branan says. \"In that world, some people are fine with whatever the bartender pulls from the bottom shelf. It's brown, it came from a barrel; they're just gonna put Coca-Cola in it and pound it until they're parched anyway. But the music that I love, and strive to make, is a little more small-batch, distilled — hopefully like a sipping whiskey.\"</p><p>Hear more of the conversation at the audio link.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
