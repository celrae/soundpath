Up 63 percent from the price a decade ago.</p><p>At least, that's the sticker price â€” the price you get if you add up tuition, room and board, and all the fees listed on the school's website.</p><p>But there's a huge gap between the sticker price and what the average student actually pays after figuring in grants and scholarships.</p><p>That's true at private colleges around the country. Nationwide, the average sticker price is more than twice as high as the price students actually pay, and the gap is getting wider.</p><p>It turns out, it makes economic sense to have a high sticker price and offer lots of discounts. On the show today, we explain why.</p><p><em>Music: The National's \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bloodbuzz-Ohio/dp/B003KVTAE8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1336769553&sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\">Bloodbuzz Ohio</a>.\" Find us:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/planetmoney\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>/<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=home#%21/planetmoney?ref=ts\" target=\"_blank\"> Facebook</a>/ </em><em><a href=\"http://open.spotify.com/user/jjiang/playlist/1G4vLCsLkm3ZOv7P0S05K6\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a>/ <a href=\"http://planetmoney.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a>.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
