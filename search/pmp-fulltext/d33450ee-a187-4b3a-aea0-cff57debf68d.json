Now she's becoming a star, but is usually labeled the \"singer in hijab\" â€” something she wants to simply make normal.","contentencoded":"<p>You might know Yuna Zarai as simply,&nbsp;the singer behind the Pharrell Williams-produced song &ldquo;Live Your Life.&rdquo;</p><p>On the track, Yuna sings, &ldquo;Find your light/Don&rsquo;t hide from what you are.&rdquo;</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/9RSXJUG8Sa0\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p><p>These lyrics are sort of a mission statement for Yuna. She began writing songs at the age of 14 and then landed a spot on&nbsp;&ldquo;One in a Million,&quot;&nbsp;Malaysia&rsquo;s version of American Idol.&nbsp;She managed to get into the&nbsp;top 40 contestants&nbsp;before being eliminated. &nbsp;</p><p>Would people know her music without the show? &quot;Probably not,&rdquo; she answers, but not in the way you&#39;d think.</p><p>&ldquo;When I went for that audition, I remember I really wanted that opportunity to just advance to the next round,&quot; Yuna says. &quot;And I did not, and I got so frustrated. I told myself, &lsquo;Well, this is not the end.&nbsp;You know how far you could go. People know that you can actually sing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>So Yuna says she began to learn the guitar and really throw herself into her song writing. It&nbsp;paid off:&nbsp;She quickly got noticed by an American&nbsp;record label, and things snowballed from there.</p><p>But most of the attention she gets in American media is focused on the fact that she is a pop star wearing a&nbsp;hijab. That often&nbsp;leads to headlines like&nbsp;&ldquo;The Muslim Pop Star,&quot; which&nbsp;L.A. Weekly used in May.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;m not going to run away from the person that I am,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It is what it is. I am a Muslim singer songwriter. I practice Islam. It&rsquo;s my religion, it&rsquo;s my belief &mdash; it&rsquo;s normal. You know, everyone has their own thing, their own beliefs. It doesn&rsquo;t stop me from getting people listening to my music.&rdquo;</p><p>Yuna has filled clubs in Boston twice in the past year, where she says her audience is diverse, consisting of &ldquo;hijabi girls, hip-hoppers&nbsp;and the Asian-American boys.&rdquo; And she says she&rsquo;s just grateful her music has been well-received.&nbsp;</p><p>[[{\"fid\":\"75481\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"height\":2932,\"width\":5212,\"alt\":\"Yuma fans Sarah (left) Sartou (right) attend the singer&#039;s Boston show.\",\"title\":\"Yuma fans Sarah (left) Sartou (right) attend the singer&#039;s Boston show.\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]</p><br>Array<br>Array","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/L1004298%202_0.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/l1004298-2jpg-0"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/1015201411.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/1015201411mp3"}]}
