They made friends with Chinese, Hawaiian and Portuguese workers. Her mother, Mary Kovner, learned English at public school and later married a Chinese man named Henry Konn. Olga was one of their three children.</p>\n<p>She recalls eating borscht, the Russian beet soup, though she admits \"my mother called <em>all</em> soup borscht, and instead of beets she used cabbage\" — even if the soup was Chinese.  </p>\n<p>Olga also recalls her home was a gathering place for Russian women, who would bring over herring and salmon eggs they brought back from trips to San Francisco. The women also drove cars. \"And this was the 1920s, not many women drove cars. But they did,\" Olga says.</p>\n<p>Olga doesn’t speak much Russian these days, although she's happy to lull you with a Russian lullaby. \"Go to sleep,\" she sings. \"God is there.\" </p>\n<p><em>During numerous conversations with Olga, our producer, Traci Tong, even discovered a family link with Olga's Chinese side. It's a small world, indeed.</em></p>\n<p>Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly characterized the relation and college of one family member. Michelle Konn Rai, a professor at Pacific Union College, is a great granddaughter of the woman in the photo.</p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/kovner%20copy.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/kovner-copyjpg"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0205201504.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0205201504mp3"}]}
