She's an artist on her own path, making music like few others.</p><p>The closest comparisons might be <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15329982/joanna-newsom\">Joanna Newsom</a> or <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/search/index.php?searchinput=diane+cluck\">Diane Cluck</a>, both of whom I admire; both are of their own place and time, and the music they make connects on a personal level. Listening feels as if you've entered their meticulously decorated living rooms. And so it is for Marian McLaughlin, with her quirky and wistful style of singing — and her unusual nylon-string guitar playing, which balances staccato and spacious sounds.</p><p>When I saw McLaughlin perform with a string quartet, I felt compelled to bring her to the Tiny Desk. Ethan Foote, the fellow on the upright bass, did the arrangements; Geoff Manyin is on cello and Nick Montopoli, on violin, is from the group Invoke. The strings add considerable atmosphere to McLaughlin's music; you can hear it especially in the opening song about Otto Lilienthal, a German mechanical engineer who was a precursor to the Wright Brothers. These three songs are from McLaughlin's self-released record on Bandcamp, titled <em>Dérive</em>.</p><h5>Set List</h5><ul><li>\"Heavier-than-air\"</li><li>\"I Am Of Ocean\"</li><li>\"Horse\"</li></ul><h5>Credits</h5><p><em>Producers: Denise DeBelius, Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Olivia Merrion, Becky Lettenberger; Production Assistant: Faith Masi; photo by Meredith Rizzo/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
