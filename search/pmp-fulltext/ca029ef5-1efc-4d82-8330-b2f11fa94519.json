All phone records, including phone records that show exclusively local calls, calls among and between Americans inside the United States, as well as a whole variety of other identifying information such as the duration of the call, the location of the users, the type of telephone they are using.\"</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On the legality:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>Greenwald: \"The cited law to justify this, which is a provision of the Patriot Act, was a law that was enacted in the wake of 9/11. The government told people who were worried about this law that it would only be used to target individuals who were suspected of being members of terrorist organizations. Here you have the law being used exactly in the opposite way.\"</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Verizon's response:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>Greenwald: \"The court order specifically says to Verizon, you are barred from disclosing the existence the FBI's request or the court order. So if Verizon had wanted to stand up in public and say the FBI is persecuting us by demanding all of our phone records, if they wanted to tell their customers, they are barred by court order. As one would expect, when we called Verizon to get comment, they dutifully said they were not able to comment.\"</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On what comes next:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>Greenwald: \"The question at this point is whether this is simply a one-time only event, which would seem very unlikely.
