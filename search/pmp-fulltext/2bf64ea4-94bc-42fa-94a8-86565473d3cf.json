But most of time we are forgetting about the people who are dying in that country.&quot;</p><p>Yeonmi&#39;s father&nbsp;was a mid-ranking civil servant who tried to make ends meet by selling gold and silver across the border in China.&nbsp;He was eventually&nbsp;arrested and sentenced to 17&nbsp;years in jail.</p><p>He returned to his family after serving a partial sentence, and that&#39;s when they decided to flee&nbsp;North Korea.</p><p>Yeonmi and her mother escaped in&nbsp;2007, sneaking across&nbsp;three mountains and a frozen lake to get to China.&nbsp;Her father stayed behind in order to minimize the risk of the whole family being arrested.</p><p>The two women made it out of the Hermit Kingdom, but&nbsp;things didn&#39;t get any better once they did.&nbsp;A smuggler threatened to report&nbsp;Yeonmi&nbsp;and her mother&nbsp;unless Yeonmi slept with him &mdash; her mother offered her own body instead.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s a memory Yeonmi still struggles with. &quot;That was my first day out of North Korea and at that time, I didn&#39;t know what sex means,&quot; she says. &quot;I was so helpless at the time and I couldn&#39;t believe people can be so cruel to us. People just seemed like I deserved it because I was from North Korea.&quot;</p><p>Her&nbsp;father&nbsp;joined them in China a short time later, but his freedom didn&#39;t last long:&nbsp;He&nbsp;died soon thereafter.</p><p>Things eventually&nbsp;start to&nbsp;turn around, if slowly.&nbsp;Yeonmi&nbsp;and her mother managed to get to Mongolia and then on to South Korea.&nbsp;That&#39;s where&nbsp;Yeonmi&nbsp;lives now, studying and teaching&nbsp;herself English by watching and re-watching&nbsp;DVDs of the American&nbsp;show &quot;Friends.&quot;</p><p>She says the&nbsp;comments from her new countrymen often surprise her.&nbsp;&quot;The first words I heard usually from people is like &#39;You just look like me,&#39;&quot; she says. &quot;&#39;You just look like us.&#39; And I was shocked,&nbsp;but I&#39;m so happy they are telling me that because not that many media is showing us as a human.&quot;</p><p>But Yeonmi&nbsp;says she hasn&#39;t forgotten about the people she left behind.&nbsp;She keeps in touch with her family and friends by phone;&nbsp;she says they can make international calls by getting close to the border to China, where their phones can pick up Chinese signals.</p><p>Doing that&nbsp;puts both them and&nbsp;Yeonmi at risk,&nbsp;but it&#39;s a&nbsp;risk they are willing to take to stay connected.</p><p>Despite the nightmares she&#39;s survived,&nbsp;Yeonmi&nbsp;wants to keep telling the world her story&nbsp;and the stories of many others like her.
