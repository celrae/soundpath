Deumling has broadcast live from the Oktoberfest opening ceremonies for 24 years, and watched the tapping up close for the previous 10 years.</p><p>The apocalypse could strike Munich, Deumling jokes, \"but if the mayor can tap the keg with two or three blows, than everything is OK.\"</p><p>For the last two decades, Munich's mayor has been Christian Ude, who has become a bit of an expert. He's managed to consistently tap the keg with just two blows.</p><p>The consistency made the whole event \"extremely boring,\" says Deumling.</p><p>It wasn't always so easy. <a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/dieter-reiter-beim-anzapfen-dreieinhalb-schlaege-fuer-das-erste-fass-1.2138788\">According to the <em>Sueddeutsche Zeitung</em></a>, Munich's mayor in 1950, Thomas Wimmer, took 17 attempts before he could successfully tap the keg.</p><p>But four months ago, Dieter Reiter entered office as Munich's new mayor, and as Oktoberfest approached, the excitement and tension began to rise.</p><p>\"[Reiter] knew that if he needed more than, I don't know, five or six blows, it would have been a disgrace,\" says Deumling.</p><p>In the days leading up to Oktoberfest, the local <a href=\"http://www.tz.de/muenchen/wiesn/dieter-reiter-geheimtraining-fuers-erste-anzapfen-3839973.html\">TZ newspaper reported</a> that Reiter had begun a secret training regimen to prepare.</p><p>Deumling says that three days before the opening ceremonies, the mayor even tapped 40 kegs in preparation.</p><p>In the end, Reiter managed his first tapping with four blows, or three-and-a-half, depending on whom you ask. (Three solid hammer blows, and one more for safety.)</p><p>Deumling's verdict?</p><p>\"Very clever.\"</p><p>Reiter managed a respectable number, but still left himself some room for improvement next year.</p><p>Plus, in the end, the beer still flowed on time.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
