A tornado ripped through the town of more than 55,000 people earlier this week. What happened in Moore, Okla., is a sad story, a reminder of how precious life can be.

He says there is a process in getting aid.</p>\n<p>\"You've got to do the hard work of doing these inventories and talking to an adjuster and then getting your claim at least filed. And then going to FEMA and filing a claim there for whatever other assistance that you feel like you need. Then you're going to have a visit from an insurance adjuster to the property and then from FEMA as well.
