In 2004, <em>Good News for People Who Love Bad News</em> launched the group from the underground into something resembling mainstream visibility. In 2007, <em>We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank</em> added a shot of rock royalty, as Johnny Marr of The Smiths joined the ranks as a co-songwriter and guitarist.</p><p>Modest Mouse's new album, <em>Strangers to Ourselves</em>, can't help but be a career mile-marker: It's the first new music from the band in eight years.
