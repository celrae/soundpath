Indeed, on the new album <em>This Is Cave Music</em>, Muschler and reed players Mike Wilbur and Wenzl McGowen have found a way to reproduce the most extreme sounds of electronic dance music — but they do it with acoustic instruments, the kinds you'd expect to find in a big orchestra. Take, for example, the song \"Contra Dubstep.\"</p><p>\"The most notably dubstep element of that song is Wenzl's contra-bass clarinet, which is the lowest clarinet of the clarinet family — it gets all the way down to the low C on the piano,\" Muschler says. \"With a contact mic on the reed going through the subwoofer, it really emulates the sound of dubstep music.\"</p><p>On his own instrument, Muschler takes his cues from a different source: Indian classical music. As he explained to NPR's Arun Rath, he devises many of his beats on Indian tablas first, then sets about a meticulous process of translating them for a standard drum kit.
