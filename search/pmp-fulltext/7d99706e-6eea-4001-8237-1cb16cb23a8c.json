About half her classmates at Greater Allegheny are also first-generation college students. That compares to about a third of undergraduates nationally. Colleges are grappling with how to help these students succeed. First-generation students are less likely to graduate on time, because they have to hold down jobs to cover their tuition or they’re not prepared for college-level work. Raven says she only read a few books in her English class last year.</p>\n<p>“I’m not scared of how the classes are going to be because I know they’re going to be hard,” she says. “I’m not going to be afraid to ask questions and get help, neither.”</p>\n<p>Raven already has&nbsp; more help than most.
