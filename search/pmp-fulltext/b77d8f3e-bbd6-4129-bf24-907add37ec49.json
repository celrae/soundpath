The case that serves as her framing device — &#8216;Tent Girl,&#8217; a young woman whose body was discovered wrapped in a striped tarpaulin off Route 25 in Scott County, Kentucky — was 30 years cold when a factory worker named Todd Matthews matched her to a listing posted by a woman in search of her long-lost sister.&#8221;</span></p><p><a title=\"AJA Citizen Investigation Cold Cases\" href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/6/7/citizen-crime-sleuths.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Al-Jazeera America</strong>: Who done it?
