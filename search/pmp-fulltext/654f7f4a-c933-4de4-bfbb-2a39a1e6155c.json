The FBI said the tools themselves contained subtle clues linking them to that country&#8217;s government.</p><p>&#8220;Sony is a corporation. It suffered significant damage. There were threats against its employees. I am sympathetic to the concerns that they faced,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/people/2788801/scott-horsley\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Scott Horsley</strong></a>, White House correspondent for NPR.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
