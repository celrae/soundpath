A new lab at the University of Miami is designed to help study how hurricanes work.</p><p><strong>Brian Haus</strong> is the director of the <a href=\"http://sustain.rsmas.miami.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">SUrge-STructure Atmosphere INteraction</a>, or SUSTAIN, lab &#8211; he tellsÂ <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now</a></em>&#8216;s Jeremy Hobson that this new facility can simulate a Category 5 Hurricane for scientists to study.</p><h4>Interview Highlights</h4><p><strong>On the lab and its capabilities</strong></p><p>&#8220;It is the largest wind-wave facility in the world, where we can blow a Category 5 hurricane wind over a water surface. And the reason this is important is because hurricanes form over the ocean, and a lot of the important interactions that occur &#8211; the things that make them stronger or weaker &#8211; happen right at the surface of the water.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the flexibility the lab offers compared to nature</strong></p><p>&#8220;We can schedule when we&#8217;re going to have a hurricane, we can have the right instruments there, we can do it again and again, and we can isolate the key processes.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On how he became interested in studying hurricanes</strong></p><p>&#8220;Seeing what Hurricane Andrew did to South Florida certainly was a strong motivation to try to understand these processes better, and over the 22 years that I&#8217;ve been there I&#8217;ve become more informed about the different scientific issues involved,&#8221; Haus said. &#8220;It&#8217;s piqued interest significantly and it&#8217;s a very exciting area of research. And at the University of Miami we have a tremendous, diverse community of people that are interested in this, so it&#8217;s an exciting place to do this kind of work and it&#8217;s been fun and [there have been] challenging problems to look at.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"l-article-media\"><div class=\"responsive-media\"><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUXis-CQGIA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Brian Haus</strong>; is professor in the department of ocean sciences in the University of Miami&#8217;s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
