Hear listener submissions, as well as personal picks from the <em>All Songs</em> crew.","itags":["npr_api","406500138"],"guid":"da3b2c46-3864-4912-a2c1-35b5d78986d4","contentencoded":"<p>What song makes you cry? It could be \"Adagio for Strings,\" but it could also be \"Highway to Hell.\" As you'll learn on this week's <em>All Songs Considered</em>, the music that gets us weeping can have as much, or more, to do with association than with composition.</p><p>Last week we <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2015/05/07/405086196/what-song-makes-you-cry-every-time?live=1\" target=\"_blank\">sent out a request</a> for songs that make our listeners cry. After reading (and sniffling) through more than 7,000 responses, we've pulled ourselves together and are ready to share a few. As if that weren't enough crumpled tissues, we also asked musician <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/396367005/christopher-paul-stelling\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Paul Stelling</a> to jump into the studio moments after performing a Tiny Desk Concert to talk to us about his pick<em>. </em>The anecdotes we share range from humorous to heartbreaking: You'll hear about magic mushrooms, a funeral dead-set on not being typical, a sequel to one of the songs featured on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2015/05/07/405086196/what-song-makes-you-cry-every-time?live=1\" target=\"_blank\">our first show on this theme, back in 2011</a> and a pact between brothers and their best friend that gets devastatingly tested, and then, sooner than anyone could imagine, tested again.</p><p>Reading and listening to your stories, we learned that what makes us all cry is sometimes in the DNA of a song. Some music is clearly written as an avenue for expressing overwhelming emotion. But other picks surprised us — AC/DC? <em>Really</em>? — until we heard how they fit in the contexts of listeners' lives. Our biggest takeaway was this: Part of the magic of art is that we stitch meaning into everything we see and hear, whether artists leave us a needle and thread or not.</p><p>We could only pick a few of the stories we heard, of course. Check back on the <em>ASC</em> blog and our social media over the next week to hear more.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
