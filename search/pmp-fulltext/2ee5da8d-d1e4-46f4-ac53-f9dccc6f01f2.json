But some say it's too early for Liberia to let its guard down.","itags":["npr_api","367596302"],"guid":"2ee5da8d-d1e4-46f4-ac53-f9dccc6f01f2","contentencoded":"<p>In Liberia, the number of new cases of Ebola is going down, but the risk has not been eliminated. To help contain the disease, schools are set to be closed until March.</p><p>But a national Senate election, which was postponed once, is now set for mid-December. That means campaigning — which means crowds.</p><p>Back in August and September, when a hundred people were getting Ebola a day, Monrovia was a ghost town. Ebola treatment units were full and regular hospitals were closed. Some people died in the streets. A lot of people stayed home.</p><p>Now, hundreds of people are heading out to those big campaign rallies. For the first time in a long time, there's a reason to party in Monrovia.</p><p>Still, many people are hanging back, and say they're trying to follow the rules in the time of Ebola: Keep your distance; no touching.</p><p>Ophelia Gaga says Ebola is all her family talks about, especially how and when to wash your hands in chlorinated water, which kills Ebola.</p><p>\"Before in the bathroom, you wash your hands, before eating you wash your hands,\" she says. \"Everything concerning me, I wash my hands day and night.\"</p><p>Washing your hands, day and night; Gaga says she's sick of washing hands. She says she's happy to just relax and dance.</p><p>Munah Krah is dancing, too. She is a member of the opposition party, which is sponsoring the event. She says she is not afraid of Ebola.</p><p>\"Because I know I am protected by God,\" she says.</p><p>Krah believes even if she weren't washing her hands, she'd still have divine protection — but, at the same time, she <em>is</em> washing her hands.</p><p>While those on the periphery seem cautious, looking deeper into the crowd, you see people flirting, hugging and touching. You also start to hear a lot of different theories about Ebola.</p><p>Some people say the fact that they're even having elections means Ebola is gone.</p><p>\"If they ... knew that Ebola was still in this country, I believe that no one gonna have elections in Liberia,\" says Marcy Taylor.</p><p>The government closed schools and markets and said no public gatherings. But now they're allowing public gatherings for elections, so some say that must mean Ebola is gone.</p><p>A government spokesman did not return calls to talk about this change of policy.</p><p>One thing that is known is that postponing the election any further would go against the constitution. Journalists here say no party wants to be criticized for doing that.</p><p>Walter Cole, who just graduated high school, says he follows the news that Ebola treatment units, or ETUs, are still being built around Liberia.</p><p>\"I still believe that Ebola is still in Liberia,\" Cole says. \"Because if there was no Ebola in Liberia, they would not be building ETUs all around town.\"</p><p>President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf says she's hoping for no new Ebola cases by Christmas — but many health officials say the president's goal is too optimistic.</p><p>Cole, for his part, says he had hoped to go to trade school this fall. But now he's just sitting at home, waiting for schools to open again.</p><p>In the meantime, the election parties are getting bigger every day.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
