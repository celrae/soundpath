So in a way, singing came first. It’s just that I found a greater creative outlet in acting and you know, the fact that I am considered competent musically for an actor means that I get to be a part of these films and I’m really grateful that I sort of tricked people into thinking that I’m a vocalist as well as an actress.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the challenge acting in the &#8216;The Last Five Years&#8217;</strong></p><p>&#8220;That frustration, even when she’s saying ‘see I’m smiling, see I’m happy,’ that frustration is underneath the surface. And layering years of resentment and frustration under this facade of trying to make it work was challenging and that’s almost a harder intention to play than letting it all out. You know, letting it all out is sort of the easy bit.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On her hopes for her career</strong></p><p>&#8220;I just want to go through it myself and have my own career that someone else could point to and go &#8216;yeah, we remember her for the good ones, but she had some stinkers.'&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dT0mrKzObw\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0447695/\" target=\"_blank\">Anna Kendrick</a></strong>, actress and singer.
