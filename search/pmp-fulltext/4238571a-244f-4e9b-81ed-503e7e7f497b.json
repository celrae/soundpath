Months later, he found out it was being used by smugglers in Turkey as a potential way to get Syrian refugees to countries where they could seek asylum.","contentencoded":"<p>It was a cold December day when Sam Neher had his pocket picked in Istanbul.</p>\n<p>Neher, a recent graduate from the University of Michigan, was wearing a winter jacket. \"My passport was in a little pocket that was zipped, underneath a buckle,\" he recalls. But when Neher and his girlfriend stopped at a café, he says, \"I noticed that the zipper was open and my passport was gone.\"</p>\n<p>He reported the passport stolen to the US Consulate in Turkey and considered the matter done — until Mike Giglio, an Istanbul-based reporter for BuzzFeed News got in touch with Neher. While working on a <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mikegiglio/stolen-passports-and-isis-fighters#.oeAa2GyAr\">story about stolen passports</a> in Turkey, Giglio had come across the one taken from Neher.</p>\n<p>\"[He said] something along the lines of 'There are murky characters here in Istanbul that have dealings with Syria and they've recovered a whole bunch of stolen American ISIS fighter passports and yours is one of them,'\" Neher says.</p>\n<p>Through Giglio, Neher learned about a whole network of underground smuggling and organized criminals in Turkey. \"[They] have a bunch of these pickpocketed passports and the pictures in the passports almost become like trading cards on smart phones,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Neher found out the smugglers try to find Syrian refugees who look like the people in the stolen passports so they can use them to get to the other countries.</p>\n<p>When Giglio contacted him, Neher says he was worried. After consulting with his father — \"parents always seem to know what to do\" — he got in touch with the State Department and left a tip on FBI's website.</p>\n<p>So far, no one has gotten in touch with him, he says.</p>\n<p>And as far as Neher knows, his passport hasn't left Istanbul. He says it exchanged hands a couple of times and ended up with one the well-known smugglers in Turkey.</p>\n<p>The experience has left Neher a little shaken, but he says he doesn't worry about traveling in the future. \"It's not a way you want to live your life,\" he says, \"I kind of tend to assume that the best will happen.\"</p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-05-22%2Famericans-passport-ended-hands-smugglers-turkey&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/story/images/Passport.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://admin.pri.org/file/passportjpg"},{"href":"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/05222015_07.mp3"},{"href":"http://admin.pri.org/file/0522201507mp3"}]}
