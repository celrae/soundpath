Who wouldn't want to do that?” says Sandra Carnahan, a professor at South Texas College of Law.\n<p>\"Is this about the patient or is this really about the doctor?” asks Carnahan. <strong>“</strong>In my opinion, it's really about the doctor wanting more money and better quality of life than it is about better patient care.\"</p>\n<p>So does concierge care keep patients healthier?

Professor Sandra Carnahan of South Texas College of Law calls concierge care “an alternative for wealthy people,\" and says that unless doctors can prove they are providing better quality care and \"not just some white-glove handling, I don’t think they’re going to be as successful as they like.”</p>\n<p><strong>Why Do People Want It?</strong></p>\n<p>Both patients and doctors say they’re turning to concierge care because they’ve become frustrated with the current health care system.
