Another type of planner is fee-only. They cannot earn a commission or accept referral fees. By law, fee-only advisers have a fiduciary responsibility with the individual they're working with. Commission and fee-based planners may have licenses with some kind of broker.</p>\n<p>To help you understand the various ways in which a financial professional can be compensated, here's some information from the <a href=\"http://www.napfa.org/\">National Association of Personal Financial Advisors</a>. How compensation is received may affect the advice you receive, if that planner faces hidden conflicts of interest. The three most common models of compensation are:</p>\n<p><strong>Fee-Only Compensation</strong> This model minimizes conflicts of interest. It is the required form of compensation for members of NAPFA. A Fee-Only financial advisor charges the client directly for his or her advice and/or ongoing management. No other financial reward is provided by any institution—which means that the advisor does not receive commissions on the actions they take on the clients’ behalf. Compensation is based on an hourly rate, a percent of assets managed, a flat fee, or a retainer.</p>\n<p><strong>Fee-Based Compensation (fee and commission)</strong> This form is often confused with Fee-Only, but it’s not the same. Fee-based advisers charge clients a fee for the advice delivered, but they also sometimes receive payments for products they sell or recommend. In some cases, commissions are credited towards the fee, giving the appearance of a lower-priced option, but any outside compensation lessens the adviser’s ability to keep the client’s best interests first and foremost.</p>\n<p><strong>Commissions</strong> NAPFA has always maintained that an adviser who is compensated through commissions is primarily a salesperson. A client working with a commissioned sales person must always ask himself: Is this advice truly in my best interest, or is it the most profitable product for the advisor? Unfortunately, often the answer is the latter. In fact, a commissioned adviser usually is required to put the best interests of his employer ahead of the best interests of his client.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Why would it ever make sense to go with a commission-based financial planner?</strong></p>\n<p>\"I have friends who are financial planners who get paid on commission, so they represent an insurance company or an investment firm. So they're going to present those as your options,\" says Sandberg. \"There is a slight bias. A fee-based is hourly, just like you would pay an attorney.\"</p>\n<p><strong>What will a financial planner cost you?</strong></p>\n<p>\"A newbie who's out there, the financial planner, they just got their CFP credentials, they could charge us $100 an hour.
