The kids camp out nearby and go to the prison during the day to do art projects with their fathers.","itags":["npr_api","340653698"],"guid":"c3a09acc-97f7-4f35-b2ba-272ce436e08e","contentencoded":"<p>On the list of activities for this summer camp: visiting Dad in a maximum security prison. The nonprofit group Hope House runs three camps to keep children connected with incarcerated dads who might not be close to home.</p><p>There are also plenty of arts and crafts, mosquito repellent and campfire songs.</p><p>Carol Fennelly founded Hope House in 1998, after a Washington, D.C.-area prison was closed, sending thousands of inmates to far-flung institutions. That made it difficult, and sometimes impossible, for relatives to visit.</p><p>Today there are three Hope House camps: one in North Carolina and two in Maryland. Fennelly also partners with groups that run summer camps in New Hampshire, Texas and California.</p><p>Inmates usually find out about the program through word of mouth or prison social workers. Dads are eligible if they have clean conduct for a year and take a parenting class.</p><p>I spent the end of summer camp with nine Hope House kids and traveled with them to visit their fathers at the Western Correctional Institution in Cumberland, Md. That's a maximum security state prison. I shared the experience on <em>Weekend Edition Saturday</em>.</p><p>You'll want to hear the kids tell their own stories, so listen to the audio above.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
