Elsewhere in the interview he said that if Muslims considered Muhammad too holy to be the target of humor, \"your God is very, very small; your prophet is a midget.\"</p><p>Charbonnier, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2015/01/07/375589758/a-magazine-staff-is-slaughtered-a-french-nightmare-is-realized\" target=\"_blank\">who was among the dozen killed in Wednesday's attack</a>, was fearless, says Jean-Luc Hess, a journalist and former head of Radio France.</p><p>\"He used to say, well, you know, 'I don't have a car, I don't have a wife, I don't have children, so what could they do to me?' You know, 'I'm not scared.' But I guess he got it wrong, because we have to take this very, very seriously.\"</p><p>James Poniewozik, a senior writer at <em>Time</em>, says the massacre poses a threat to any satire.</p><p>The genre already is treated skittishly by media companies, as seen in Sony Pictures' initial decision <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/12/17/371477960/major-theater-chains-wont-screen-the-interview-amid-threats\" target=\"_blank\">to pull the North Korea-mocking comedy <em>The Interview</em></a> following a hacking and threats of violence.</p><p>And <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126283217\" target=\"_blank\">when the TV cartoon <em>South Park</em> was planning to depict Muhammad in an episode</a>, \"it didn't require anyone physically attacking the Comedy Central offices for somebody to get nervous and say, 'Oh, you know, this isn't worth it,' \" and censor the offending image, says Poniewozik.</p><p>Such moves are unacceptable to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/books/authors/138031213/salman-rushdie\" target=\"_blank\">author Salman Rushdie</a>, a fatwa-targeted novelist <a href=\"http://www.englishpen.org/campaigns/salman-rushdie-condemns-attack-on-charlie-hebdo/\" target=\"_blank\">who released a statement Wednesday urging people to defend satire</a>, \"a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity.\"</p><p>Those words probably would have been appreciated by Charbonnier, who in the interview with Rougier-Chapman after the 2011 firebombing said there was no way <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> would back down.</p><p>\"We have no choice,\" he said. \"If we [cease] to publish, we are dead.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
