At 18, he was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcFX7y1Gt4I\" target=\"_blank\">discovered via YouTube</a>; now, at 21, he's released a debut album that's No. 1 in England.</p><p>Before he made <em>Wanted On Voyage</em>, Ezra took a solo train trip across Europe for inspiration, as he eavesdropped on conversations and took notes to find starting points for songs. Written after a night of drunken revelry and a missed train, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHrLPs3_1Fs\" target=\"_blank\">Budapest</a>\" takes its title from a city he never got to visit. So, while trying his hand at a love song, Ezra decided to write about all the beautiful things he would give up for love: \"golden grand piano, my beautiful <em>castillo</em>, my acres of land.\" Of course, he owns none of those things.</p><p>If Ezra's album title sounds familiar, you might remember the words inscribed on Paddington Bear's suitcase.</p><p>\"When I was a kid, my mom used to dress me up as him,\" Ezra tells NPR's Melissa Block. \"If it was cold out, I'd have a blue duffle coat. I'd have my wellies on.\"</p><p>When taking a long boat journey, Ezra later learned, people would write \"wanted on voyage\" on their luggage to signify they wanted them on the trip.</p><p>\"I liked the idea of people listening to a record that I wrote while I traveled while they traveled and wanted it on their journey,\" Ezra says.</p><p>Things are looking up for George Ezra, whose adorable video for \"Listen To The Man\" features Sir Ian McKellen lip-syncing along. But Ezra says he's aware that attention spans are short.</p><p>\"I always say, if this is the only album I get to release, so be it. I've had the best time,\" Ezra says. \"I'll continue writing and creating. If people get to hear it, then that's amazing. I don't want people to think that I don't love this; I do.</p><p>\"I think also that things move so quickly now, as well. I think that's the same with audiences in music â€” I think before they know it, they're being pitched the next act that they should be getting into. It's a lot more accessible now. If I can sit here when I'm 60 and talking about my 15th, 20th record, well, happy days, I'd love that. But we'll see.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
