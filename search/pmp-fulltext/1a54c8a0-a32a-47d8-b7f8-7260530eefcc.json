It made us feel good and it worked visually for us. I think its about simplicity in those videos and the connection between the audience and the performers. It&#8217;s about that eye contact. You see a lot  music videos these days which are so over-cut and so over-lit. And it&#8217;s just, like, almost scared that we&#8217;re gonna lose the attention of the audience if its not going a million miles an hour. I think we just wanted to pare it back and present the simplest idea and see if that caught.&#8221;</p><p><strong>McFarland on incorporating nontraditional instruments into their sound</strong></p><p>&#8220;We were working in the studio and I went out to make a coffee. The studio, by the way, is just J&#8217;s bedroom. It&#8217;s nothing particularly glamorous. I just walked out of the door and the door creaked while J was working on the bass line. And he was like, &#8216;Stop, stop, stop!&#8217; and I was like, &#8216;I&#8217;m not making you another coffee, dude.&#8217; And he was like, &#8216;No, no, no. That door sounded <em>incredible</em>.&#8217; And I walked back in the room and he&#8217;d already got a mic next to the door. So, I just stood there for 10 minutes opening and closing this really creaky door as we recorded it over the track.&#8221;</p><p><strong>McFarland on their recent success</strong></p><p>&#8220;You never expect to be in a position where you can do this. A year ago we were sitting in J&#8217;s bedroom making beats and now we&#8217;re in a studio in Boston. It will always surprise us. I think that&#8217;s the beauty of it. As soon as it stops surprising us and stops becoming something that&#8217;s enjoyable and new, I think that&#8217;s when you need to move on and try something else.&#8221;</p><h4>Songs Heard In This Segment</h4><p><em>All songs by Jungle</em></p><p>&#8220;The Heat&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4UckOGdZtI\">[Youtube]</a></p><p>&#8220;Platoon&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JkDzNOgO3U\">[Youtube]</a></p><p>&#8220;Busy Earnin&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcsfftwLUf0\">[Youtube]</a></p><p>&#8220;Julia&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Drops&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2IjxP-62LU\">[Youtube]</a></p><p>&#8220;Smoking Pixels&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Crumbler&#8221;</p><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><strong>Josh Lloyd-Watson</strong>, founding member of Jungle.</li><li><strong>Tom McFarland</strong>, founding member of Jungle.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
