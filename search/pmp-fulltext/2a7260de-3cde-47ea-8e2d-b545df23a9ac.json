a legal doctrine called <em>cy pr</em><em>ès, “</em>they’ll have to show that the restricted gift is no longer possible,” says Smith.&nbsp; For example, if the will said the money was to cure a disease and that disease was cured.&nbsp; The charity will also have to ask a court for permission “to use those funds for the nearest similar purpose.”</p>\n<p>Sometimes an institution will have a
