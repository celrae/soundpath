That album was released in ’72. It’s just her first name, “Elis.”</p>\n<br />\n<p>I live in Brooklyn, and I was walking to dinner with my girlfriend. We came across a milk crate of records. I mean they were trash, but you know, a lot of people <em>like</em> looking through trash for this sort of thing. But we were also late to dinner. So I hid them behind some random person’s stoop, went to dinner, came back, they were still there, and took them home. This album was one of the albums in there, and I couldn’t stop listening to it.</p>\n<br />\n<p>I think this is my favorite song off of that album: An incredibly catchy track that you can’t help but move to.&nbsp; And I don’t understand a word of it — I <em>assume</em> it has something to do about dancing.</p>\n<br />\n<p>So this track will be playing as dinner starts. I think that’s important, because when people start eating what I <em>guarantee</em> will be a delicious meal, people aren’t gonna be doing much talking anyway — they’re gonna be eating!&nbsp; So it’s good digestive music.</p>\n<br />\n<p>It’s an amazing track. It’s so rhythmic and so harmonic.

I was listening to a lot of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyjTrwOMSO4\">Third Eye Blind</a> and my other brother, who was very ‘on the scene,’ sent me this track as a way to kind of make me a little bit hipper than all my other friends. And I felt <em>so</em> hip listening to this song. It was all I really played for six months.</p>\n<br />\n<p>This track I chose for dessert is really beat-oriented — Boards of Canada is very beat-oriented — so it kind of puts that pulse back inside you again. It kind of gets you moving a little bit, and working off that fantastic dinner that we just had.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Most Boards of Canada is pretty chill; there’s never any lyrics to my knowledge.&nbsp; And still, to this day, I will put it on doing random tasks.&nbsp; Filling out my taxes.
