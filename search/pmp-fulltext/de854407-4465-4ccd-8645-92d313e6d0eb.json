There's a whole group of female riders in Dubai, and reporter Amanda Fisher decided to spend some time with them. \"I realized how many strong women there are here that defy the cliché archetype of the oppressed Arab woman,\" Fisher says.</p>\n<p>She tells the story of another rider, Shima Mehri, an Iranian woman who had wanted to ride a motorcycle since she was a little girl. Women in Iran are allowed to drive, but it's illegal for them to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/13/roaring-to-go-the-female-motorbike-rider-who-wants-to-race-for-iran\">ride motorcycles in public</a>.</p>\n<p>Mehri and her husband moved to Dubai when she was 29, and that's when she finally got her motorcycle licence. \"As soon as I reached Dubai, I said 'OK, this is the time,'\" she told Fisher.</p>\n<p>But things didn't go smoothly when Mehri told her mother about her decision.
