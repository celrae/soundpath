But the industry's future is murky, as government subsidies are set to expire within two years.","itags":["npr_api","377719667"],"guid":"37e24f93-f597-4fb9-8993-2bb2b2f0837e","contentencoded":"<p>The solar energy business is <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/11/solar-energy-power-boom-charts\">growing fast</a>, thanks in part to a steep drop in panel prices.</p><p>The Solar Energy Industries Association reports that <a href=\"http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-data\" target=\"_blank\">prices dropped</a> by more than half since 2010. But the industry's future looks a little hazy. Generous <a href=\"http://www.seia.org/policy/finance-tax/solar-investment-tax-credit\" target=\"_blank\">government subsidies expire soon</a> and the price for natural gas — a competitor that's also used to generate electricity — keeps dropping.</p><p>For now, though, the solar business is booming and the industry is hiring. More than 31,000 solar jobs were added in 2014, according to <a href=\"http://thesolarfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Solar Foundation</a>.</p><p>Among those who became solar industry workers last year is Charlie Wilde, 54, of Denver. He finished a training program at <a href=\"http://www.solarenergy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Solar Energy International</a> in the spring, got certified and then worked temp jobs as an installer.</p><p>\"It's really hard work, especially in the summertime, when you're on those hot roofs,\" Wilde says.</p><p>He sees a bright future in solar panels and is starting his own business called <a href=\"http://www.ecology-solar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ecology Solar</a>.</p><p>\"I'll be targeting people in my neighborhood of Denver, Colo., and then expand out from there as the business grows,\" Wilde says.</p><p>Experienced installers can earn a <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes472231.htm\" target=\"_blank\">good wage</a> of about $22 per hour, says Andrea Luecke, president and executive director of The Solar Foundation.</p><p>\"People in sales positions are making about $40 an hour,\" she says. \"So these are good jobs. These are highly desirable jobs, and jobs that are helping to positively contribute to the U.S. economy.\"</p><p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't track <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/green/solar_power/\" target=\"_blank\">solar industry</a> employment, but it cites figures from Luecke's foundation.</p><p>\"We have nearly <a href=\"http://thesolarfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">174,000 solar jobs in the U.S.</a>, which is 22 percent more than last year and 86 percent more than when we first started to track jobs in 2010,\" Luecke says.</p><p>And she says there is plenty of room for more growth, because solar makes up <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=427&t=3\" target=\"_blank\">less than 1 percent</a> of the electricity generated in the U.S. today. Two-thirds of the country's power still comes from coal and natural gas, according to the Energy Information Administration.</p><p>Luecke says the solar industry expects to add another <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/01/15/3611522/solar-jobs-report-2014/\" target=\"_blank\">36,000 jobs this year</a>, but after that is a big question mark. Solar companies still rely on a <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/229050-let-the-sun-set-on-the-solar-industry-subsidy\" target=\"_blank\">30 percent federal tax credit</a> to compete with more established fossil fuels. Unless Congress extends the credit, it will end in December 2016.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
