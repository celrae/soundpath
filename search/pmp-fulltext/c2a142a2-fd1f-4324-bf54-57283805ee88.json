The effort will work through a new app, being developed by the New York Public Library, that has the buy-in of all the major publishers.</p><p>\"Children should not be unable to get reading materials because their parents don't have money,\" says Carolyn Reidy, president and CEO of Simon & Schuster, which has offered up all of its titles for kids from 4 to 14.</p><p>Candlewick Press, publisher of the popular <em>Judy Moody</em> series, is also opening its catalog.</p><p>\"We really, really care about getting books to all kids,\" says Candlewick CEO Karen Lotz. \"Kids who can't afford them. Kids who are in rural areas and not near bookstores.\"</p><p>If there's a fly in the ointment, it's one little letter: e.</p><p>Publishers aren't giving kids a quarter of a billion dollars' worth of free books. They're free e-books. Which require two things:</p><p>A good Internet connection — at least at school if not at home — and some sort of device to read them.</p><p>And that's a challenge. According to the Census Bureau, in 2013 nearly 40 percent of households that earned less than $25,000 a year <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/acs/acs-28.pdf\">didn't have a computer</a>. Forty percent. And fewer than half had an Internet subscription.</p><p>The Obama administration can't simply give a computer or tablet to every kid who wants to read an e-book. But it has made it <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/k-12/connected\">a priority</a> to get broadband into just about every public school and library by 2018.</p><p>The nation's chief technology officer, Megan Smith, says part of the plan involves \"really leveraging libraries as a third place; if families don't have access to devices at home, the children can get to the library and [get in] that habit.\"</p><p>To help make that happen, the White House is also running a program in more than 30 cities and counties to give every student a library card.</p><p>As for the e-book titles that will be available through the new program, it's a growing list that includes Dr. Seuss, <em>Twilight</em> and, of course, <em>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
