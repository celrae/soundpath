These are the moments when everything seems to click, and people leap forward into their careers</em><em>.</em></p><p>You know actress Jane Seymour from the frontier town of Colorado Springs in the hit TV show <em>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</em>.</p><p>Long before she made it in Hollywood as a symbol of the American frontier, Seymour was a little-known British actress. She met with two movie producers in England who were working on a new James Bond film — 1973's <em>Live and Let Die.</em></p><p>They needed a Bond girl, and they invited Seymour to audition.</p><p>\"I was wearing a coat with a fur collar and a fur hat,\" Seymour says. \"The idea being to keep my hair off my face and then when I took the hat off, my hair-- which was very long and I sat on in those days — came tumbling down.\"</p><p>Seymour credits that hair-tumble for getting the role of the tarot card-reading psychic Solitaire. The producers hired her on the spot.</p><p>She was just 20 years old.</p><p>\"All I remember [about] doing the Bond film was it was such a big deal,\" she says. \"It was Roger [Moore]'s first one and I really became very good friends with the stuntmen.\"</p><p>That's because Seymour did her own stunt in a high-speed chase scene. James Bond drives a double-decker bus under a low-hanging bridge while Solitaire sits inside. As they drive under the bridge, the top of the bus gets torn off.</p><p>\"The idiots put me in the bus,\" she says. \"I mean, Roger [Moore] wasn't there, no one else was there ... It could've been anybody could have played that. But I was in there and I said, 'Have you done this before?' And they went, 'No, we did it mathematically. We hope it works. Action!' \"</p><p>Luckily, the stunt was flawless and her role as Solitaire became her big break.</p><p>\"It wasn't really hard to get roles directly after that,\" she says. \"I met Renée Valente, who was a casting director at the time. And she said, 'If you can lose your English accent, you would do very well in America.' \"</p><p>Following Valente's advice, Seymour brushed up on her American accent and moved from England to Hollywood.</p><p>\"I came to America with no work permit, no agent, nowhere really to live, and within six weeks I got my first role,\" she says.</p><p>It was in the 1976 mini-series <em>Captain and the Kings. </em></p><p>\"I became labeled as the 'queen of the mini-series' because I did one mini-series after another,\" she says. \"Basically, I worked consistently and usually with a different American accent every time.\"</p><p>While Seymour may have been at the top of her career, she was also in crippling debt — and didn't even know it.</p><p>\"I'd been married to one of the top business managers and one day I found out that I was completely beyond bankrupt,\" she says. \"Like $9 million in the red with lawsuits from every major bank including the FDIC.\"</p><p>At the time, she says she had no idea what happened to her money.</p><p>\"I was married to a financial expert so when he said, 'Sign here,' I did. Of course, it was the housing market, and he'd been getting me to personally sign,\" she says.</p><p>On the verge of losing her house and with two children to take care of, Seymour was desperate for more work.</p><p>\"I called my agent and I said, 'I will do anything. Please tell the networks,' \" she says.</p><p>CBS came back with a pilot called, <em>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</em>. Her agent told her that she'd have to commit for five years and sign the contract by the following morning.</p><p>The lead role of Dr. Michaela \"Mike\" Quinn wasn't a promising one, either. Seymour says no one believed in the show. They told her it would never work.</p><p>\"A woman in the lead, that doesn't work. Medical show, that doesn't work. Western, definitely doesn't work. Children and animals, definitely doesn't work. Family values? Forget about it,\" Seymour says.</p><p>But the show was an instant hit and Jane Seymour became a household name.</p><p>\"One of the proudest things I've done is <em>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. </em>It was such a remarkable series,\" she says.</p><p>But she's enjoyed playing roles beyond Dr. Mike.</p><p>\"I've had the privilege of playing leading ladies, victims and then of course evil people — I'm very good at evil,\" she says. \"I love acting.\"</p><p><em><em>We want to hear about </em>your<em> big break.
