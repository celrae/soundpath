He says the director of <em>The Graduate</em> and <em>Death of a Salesman</em> started as a performer but quickly built a career offstage as one of entertainment's most-honored creative leaders. He says:</p><blockquote><p>\"On a movie set or Broadway stage, Mike Nichols excelled at building iconic dramatic scenes. In the 1971 film <em>Carnal Knowledge</em>, he bounced reluctant boyfriend Jack Nicholson off needy lover Ann-Margret.</p><p>\"Nichols' skills made instant classics of plays like Neil Simon's <em>The Odd Couple</em> and films such as <em>The Graduate</em> and <em>Silkwood</em>. He started as a performer with actress/writer Elaine May, but Nichols' greatest work was as a director. In his long career, he earned Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.</p><p>\"Still, Nichols said his life didn't really start until meeting his fourth wife, ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer.\"</p></blockquote><p>NPR spoke to Nichols in 2012.
