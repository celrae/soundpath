She was also HIV positive: her mother got the diagnosis when Rawl was a toddler.</p><p>But despite her daily medication regimen, she was a pretty typical kid.</p><p>Until middle school, when Rawl told her best friend about her HIV status. The word spread and a bullying campaign began: Rawl was dubbed &#8220;PAIDS&#8221; by her schoolmates, received anonymous notes and was dropped by all of her friends. School administrators were unresponsive and the stress grew to such a point that Rawl began developing physical symptoms.</p><p>&#8220;I was having stress induced seizures, I lost about 20 pounds, my hair began to fall out, I also was catatonic,&#8221; Rawl told <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org\"><em>Here & Now&#8217;</em></a>s Robin Young. She even contemplated suicide.</p><p>Through counseling, a more supportive high school and the friendships of others in the HIV-AIDS community, Rawl eventually found the strength to not only bring a lawsuit against her former school, but to become an AIDS educator and an anti-bullying activist. She&#8217;s now published &#8220;Positive,&#8221;a memoir written with Ali Benjamin.</p><p><div class=\"secthead\"><div class=\"sectheadtxt\">Positive by Paige Rawl</div></div><div class=\"scribd_embed\"><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"//www.scribd.com/embeds/240274144/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-7V7yU1wuMaG1d9fOAx13\" data-auto-height=\"true\"data-aspect-ratio=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div></p><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;color: #222222\">Excerpted from the book POSITIVE by Paige Rawl with Ali Benjamin.
