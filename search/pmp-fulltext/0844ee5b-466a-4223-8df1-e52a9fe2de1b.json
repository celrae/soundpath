It was the 1980s, and she says she had no idea.</p><p>\"When you called and came out, it was quite a shock. I had no inkling--none whatsoever. You tell me you're gay, and I said, 'Listen. Give me a half hour to come to myself, and I'll call you back,'\" she tells her son on a visit to StoryCorps in New York City.</p><p>She did call him back. She said \"this is not a telephone discussion. I think you best come speak with dad and I. But don't worry; we're going to love you the same way.\"</p><p>Her son Jay, now 65, says he thought she knew. \"When you talked about not knowing about me being gay, I mean, I consider you a lot of things, but dumb isn't one of them. And I had left so many clues. I had somebody over for three times a week for five years.\"</p><p>\"In your house. I had a f*** buddy.\"</p><p>\"That's what you call them? F*** buddies?\" Rita says. \"I don't know what you call them, but I didn't know, and that's all. I would not be so dumb now. I have what they call gaydar.\"</p><p>She says a \"very high point\" was taking part in Jay and his partner Michael's commitment ceremony. \"Dad I and were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary. And you suggested that we make it a joint celebration. And when dad and I walked you down that aisle. I was so overwhelmed that I thought I was going to drop dead from a heart attack. It was one of my bursting moments of pride,\" Rita tells her son.</p><p>\"I consider you a blessing to both me and Michael. And that's as best as I can put it,\" Jay says.</p><p>\"I think straight parents should be involved with their gay children. I told everybody and anybody who would listen to me, that I had a gay son and that I was very proud of my gay son.\"</p><p><em>Audio produced for </em>Tell Me More<em> by Jud Esty-Kendall.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
