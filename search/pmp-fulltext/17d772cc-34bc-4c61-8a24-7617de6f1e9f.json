The latest proposal in Washington is called 25 by 25. It calls for the US to get a quarter of its energy from renewable sources by 2025. But getting this through Congress is another matter. Here's Sam Eaton.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>SAM EATON:</strong> It's one of those rare occasions in Washington: An energy resolution with bipartisan support as well as a seal of approval from environmental groups, the farm lobby and the big 3 automakers. Sound like a sure thing? Don't count on it.<br />\n<br />\nTimothy Profeta heads the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy at Duke University.

They're more into taking the issues into a public forum and using it to try and defeat their opponents.</blockquote>\nThat means the 25 by 25 legislation and the host of other bills circulating Capital Hill will likely do just that. Circulate. That is until the next Congress is sworn in. Profeta says unlike many other campaign issues, the energy problem isn't going away anytime soon.<br />\n<br />\nI'm Sam Eaton for</div>","title":"Reducing oil dependency 25 by 25","audio":[{"meta":{"api":{"type":"application/json","href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm-audio:/marketplace/morning_report/2006/06/08_mktmorn0450"},"duration":0,"duration_hms":null},"format":"MP3","href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/marketplace/morning_report/2006/06/08_mktmorn0450_128.mp3","type":"audio/mpeg"},{"meta":{"api":{"href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm-audio:/marketplace/morning_report/2006/06/08_mktmorn0450","type":"application/json"},"duration":0,"duration_hms":null},"format":"MP3","href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/marketplace/morning_report/2006/06/08_mktmorn0450_128.mp3","type":"audio/mpeg"}]}
