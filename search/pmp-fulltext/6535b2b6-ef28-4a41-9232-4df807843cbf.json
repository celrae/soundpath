For example, given the word \"amiable,\" the answer is \"Mobile\" (Alabama).</p><p><strong>Last week's challenge </strong>Think of a common two-word phrase for something you might see in a kitchen. Reverse the words — that is, put the second word in front of the first — and you'll name a food, in one word, that you might prepare in a kitchen. What is it?</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Cake pan and pancake.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> Sarah Milstein of Brooklyn, N.Y.</p><p><strong>Next week's challenge: </strong></p><p>This challenge comes from listener Rudy Simons of Southfield, Mich. The letters of the one-syllable word \"groan\" can be rearranged to spell \"organ,\" which has two syllables. Here's the challenge: Think of a common one-syllable, five-letter word whose letters can be rearranged to spell a common two-syllable word — and then rearranged again to spell a common three-syllable word. I have two different answers in mind, and it's possible there are others, but you only have to think of one.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://help.npr.org/npr/includes/customer/npr/custforms/contactus.aspx?pz=t\">Submit Your Answer</a></strong></p><p>If you know the answer to next week's challenge, submit it <a href=\"http://help.npr.org/npr/includes/customer/npr/custforms/contactus.aspx?pz=t\">here</a>.
