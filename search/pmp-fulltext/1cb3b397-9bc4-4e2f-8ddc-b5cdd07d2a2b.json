Duke University behavioral scientist Peter Ubel is betting that will have an effect.</p>\n<p>“There will be a reckoning. We have to tell them whether we have insurance or not. And if we don't have it that might really feel bad and be enough to change your mind about what you want to do next year,” he says.</p>\n<p>Plenty of people don't have the luxury to give into subtle psychological cues and nudges.

So it's like a gamble,” says Grey.</p>\n<p>It's a gamble the government estimates roughly 6 million Americans will take, and many will pay the penalty.</p>\n<p>MIT’s Jon Gruber thinks one way to reach the holdouts -- the people really set against buying insurance: good old-fashioned peer pressure.
