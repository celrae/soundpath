He remains the largest individual shareholder in the company.</p><p>Ballmer spent $2 billion of his roughly $20 billion fortune on the Clippers purchase, which a judge confirmed last week.</p><p>As Microsoft's CEO, he was known for his loud and enthusiastic cheerleading at developer conferences. He brought that same energy to a public Clippers gathering earlier this week during a rally at the Staples Center.</p><p>Now that all that energy is going into the Clippers and teaching jobs, Ballmer wrote it would be impractical for him to continue to serve on the board.</p><p>Analyst Merv Adrian of Gartner, a leading information technology research and advisory company, thinks Ballmer also saw that Microsoft's new CEO Satya Nadella is steering the company on a new course.</p><p>\"The current directions and restructuring underway at Microsoft are substantially different from the ones that Steve was responsible for,\" he says.</p><p>Adrian says Ballmer was always a Microsoft first kind of leader, and Nadella is moving in a direction that will enable the company's software and technology to work more easily with the products of other companies.</p><p>Ballmer did say in his resignation letter that he promised to continue to hold his position as Microsoft's largest individual shareholder into the foreseeable future.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
