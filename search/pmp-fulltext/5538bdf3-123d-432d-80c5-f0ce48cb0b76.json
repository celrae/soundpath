The hike was one of the final two stages of the 430-mile <a href=\"http://www.arworldseries.com/\">Adventure Racing World Championship</a> in Ecuador.</p>\n<p>Then Lindnord, the captain of <a href=\"http://www.teampeakperformance.se/\">Team Peak Performance</a>, tossed part of his lunch to a thin, scruffy street dog begging for food at his feet — and inadvertently enlisted a fifth team member, who they named Arthur.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-original_image\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/2000_width/public/arthur7.jpg?itok=L7byddCT\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"image__credit\">\n    <span class=\"image__credit-label\">\n      Credit:\n    </span>\n    <p>Krister Göransson/Peak Performance</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Arthur and Team Peak performance in the Amazon rainforest.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Adventure Racing is an extreme sport that combines continuous hiking, trekking, mountain biking and kayaking over a successive number of days.</p>\n<p>The team trudged for hours in the deep mud and steep terrain, but \"the dog continued to follow us,” Lindnord says.
