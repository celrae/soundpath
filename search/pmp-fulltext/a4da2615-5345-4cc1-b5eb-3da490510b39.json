As Mahlasela says, \"Freedom is not enough.\" Economic freedom is what's required now, he argues, and \"that's what we're struggling and fighting for back home.\" </p>\n<p>As an elder statesman, he struggles a bit to make sure the younger generation understands the impact music had during apartheid, a bit fearful that \"our kids will forget.\" But, he's not <em>that</em> pessimistic. He notes that songs are still being sung from the townships, vibrant songs about hope that encourage action in some way. </p>\n<p>And that's exactly what Vusi Mahlasela and Hugh Masekela are doing in the United States. The duo are on tour in the United States, celebrating 21 years of freedom and post-apartheid South Africa.  </p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/U875ysTSwKM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-03-03%2Fvusi-mahlasela&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0306201511.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0306201511mp3"}]}
