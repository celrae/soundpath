'All the soldiers and the officers are here. We are all boys who won't shoot our own people,' said the soldier, whose uniform did not have any identifying markings on it. 'They haven't fed us for three days on our base. They're feeding us here. Who do you think we are going to fight for?' he said.\"</p><p></blockquote></p><p>In the city of Kramatorsk, though, there are \"no Russian flags to be seen,\" Ari reported. It was there, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/04/15/303183031/ukrainian-military-moves-against-pro-russia-protesters\" target=\"_blank\">as we noted Tuesday</a>, that Ukrainian troops regained control of the local airfield. \"A couple people were wounded\" during a brief clash with pro-Russia gunmen, Ari said, \"but we're told that nobody was killed.\"</p><p>Still, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27045534\" target=\"_blank\">the BBC writes that</a> while \"Ukrainian troops have entered the eastern town of Kramatorsk ... they were blocked by civilians and the situation is unclear, amid reports that some may have abandoned their vehicles or even changed sides.\"</p><p>Ukraine's acting defense minister, Mykhailo Koval, is reportedly going to Kramatorsk. He will attempt to send a message, Ari said, that the central government is still in control of the region. But most of the locals he has met in eastern Ukraine, Ari added, \"emphatically agree\" with the protesters who want to join the Russian Federation.</p><p>As <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/04/14/302874410/in-ukraine-pro-russia-occupiers-stay-put-war-fears-grow\" target=\"_blank\">we've written before,</a> there are fears about what may happen if there are clashes between Ukrainian forces and the demonstrators in a part of Ukraine where many residents are ethnic Russians.</p><p>The White House on Wednesday said it was appropriate for Ukraine to take action to restore order.

Russia says they were conducting military exercises.</p><p>Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen says the western alliance is strengthening its forces in the region, a move aimed at \"deterrence and deescalation\" in the face of Russia's aggressive posture. Specifically, Rasmussen said NATO warships would be dispatched to the Baltic Sea, where the alliance's air policing aircraft would also fly more sorties. Further deployments could come in the eastern Mediterranean or elsewhere as needed, he said, according to the AP.</p><p>Last month, Russian forces moved into what was the Ukrainian-controlled Crimean Peninsula.
