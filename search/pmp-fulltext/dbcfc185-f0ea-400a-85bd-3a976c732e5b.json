The excerpts contain an interview with one of the convicted rapists of the Delhi gang rape victim of December, 2012. These excerpts were telecast on various channels throughout the day, with visuals of the convict, who was showing no remorse whatsoever for the heinous act. Further, the excerpts also contained his chauvinistic and derogatory views regarding women in general and the victim in particular. These programmes also provided a platform for the convict to use the media to further his own case, especially when his appeal against his conviction, is sub-judice. Whereas the telecast of these excerpts appear to encourage and incite violence against women, thus compromising women's public safety. They also provide encouragement to antisocial elements to indulge in violent acts compromising law and order.</em></p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_border cta_align-left cta_icon-engagement cta_bg-white\" data-entity-id=\"76520\" data-entity-title=\" related story\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-76520\" class=\"node node-story-act story-act-cta story-act-nid-76520 cta-type-internal-link cta-style-learn clearfix\" about=\"/node/76520\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/76520\">Story Act: related story</a></h2>\n<p>    <span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Story Act: related story\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    Related Story  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-internal-link\">\n<div id=\"node-76502\" class=\"node node-story clearfix\" about=\"/stories/2015-03-05/director-indias-daughter-flees-india-out-fear-shell-be-arrested\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/stories/2015-03-05/director-indias-daughter-flees-india-out-fear-shell-be-arrested\">The director of 'India's Daughter' flees India out of fear she'll be arrested</a></h2>\n<p>    <span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"The director of 'India's Daughter' flees India out of fear she'll be arrested\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<p>  <figure class=\"field-image\"><br /><a href=\"/stories/2015-03-05/director-indias-daughter-flees-india-out-fear-shell-be-arrested\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/story/images/Udwin_2.jpg?itok=A_Vy0b1b\" width=\"100\" height=\"56\" /></a>  </figure></p>\n<ul class=\"field-terms-sections field-terms-sections teaser-list__item-meta teaser-list__item-program\"><li>\n      <a href=\"/sections/media\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Media</a>    </li>\n<li>\n      <a href=\"/sections/arts-culture-media\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Arts, Culture &amp; Media</a>    </li>\n</ul><p class=\"field-date-published field-date-published story__meta\">\n    <span class=\"date-display-single\" property=\"dc:date\" datatype=\"xsd:dateTime\" content=\"2015-03-05T14:30:00-05:00\">March 05, 2015</span>  </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Indian authorities in New Delhi have blocked the documentary's broadcast because it contains an interview with a convicted — and unremorseful — rapist from the bombshell 2012 rape case that sparked a global outcry.

Sadly ... the banning of the film will see India isolated in the eyes of the world.
