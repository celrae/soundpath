Tech companies are in hot pursuit of the dream. There’s Apple’s Siri. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/24/amazon-gets-into-voice-recognition-buys-ivona-software-to-compete-against-apples-siri/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"http://labs.microsofttranslator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a> are also moving into voice technology. Your Xbox may be talking to you in the future.\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And, today, at its big developers conference Google announced that Google Voice is moving beyond phones to desktops and laptops. I recently caught up with <a href=\"http://research.google.com/pubs/author6921.html\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Huffman</a>, who leads the Google Voice team.</p>\nSitting in a conference room at Google’s Mountain View headquarters, Huffman pulled out his Android and asked it this question. “How far is San Louis Obispo from here?” he asked.\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;“The drive from your location to San Luis Obispo is 197.6 miles,” Google voice answered.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Voice recognition technology -- or simply transcribing the phonetics of the spoken word -- is commonplace. Call centers use it a lot. But tech companies are racing to actually “teach” computers to understand “language.” Remember, Huffman’s question: How far is San Louis Obispo from here?</p>\nHe says the example shows how steep that learning curve is.\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“I like this example because of the word here, such a simple word but if you actually think about it means a lot of different things,” Huffman said.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There’s “hear” – as in I can “hear” you. And then “here I am.” And here’s another example...</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Getting a computer to understand the we speak naturally is sorta like teaching it to become human. &nbsp;Huffman says it’s a long ways off.
