For the first time in years, no summer blockbuster has managed to crack the $300 million barrier at the North American box office. In fact, until <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> came along, the film industry was looking at its lowest attendance figures in more than a decade.</p><p>Still, hope springs eternal, and with nearly 100 pictures lined up for the fall, there are bound to be a few that get pulses racing again.</p><p>Intriguingly, none of them — not even one — qualifies as a straight-up superhero movie. There is a black comedy about an actor who once played a superhero, and who is now so down on his luck he's fantasizing about a return to stardom ... on stage. That's Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJfLoE6hanc\">Birdman</a>, with former Batman Michael Keaton suffering an elaborately visualized breakdown in the title role. Critics have been raving since the film's Venice Film Fest premiere earlier this week.</p><p>They've also had affirmative things to say about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jpAVB1JuMc\">Rosewater</a>, the film that first-time writer/director Jon Stewart took a leave of absence from <em>The Daily Show</em> to shepherd to the screen. Rosewater tracks the tough ordeal Iranian journalist (and <em>Daily Show</em> guest) Maziar Bahari was put through in an Iranian prison after authorities there decided his work for foreign news organizations amounted to spying.</p><p>And if the Middle East doesn't darken your mood, director Christopher Nolan may manage it in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePbKGoIGAXY\">Interstellar</a>, a vision of a future where humankind is rapidly running out of food, and the world's best minds are convinced that their task is not to save the earth, but to find a way to escape it.</p><p>Cheery stuff — and all hitting theaters before Thanksgiving, after which the awards contenders come out to play: Broadway musicals, biblical epics, hobbits. The sun'll come out tomorrow, dontcha know.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
