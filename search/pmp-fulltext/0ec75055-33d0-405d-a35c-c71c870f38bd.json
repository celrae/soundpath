I wanted snarling electric guitars. Feedback. To rock. And here, old people would break into three-part harmony in line for the bathroom.</p><p>My brother and I derisively started calling folkies \"hey gangers\" after one overly-cheery stranger greeted us one afternoon with a big, smiley \"Hey gang!\" It was annoying. My teen mind was not inspired. Off to see the \"hey gangers.\" I wanted Jimmy Page. I got Pete Seeger.</p><p>My dad would tell me, in essence, you'll thank me later.</p><p>Sure enough, at one of Seeger's festivals, a few hundred people were packed into a small stage area to hear this chubby man with big cheeks and a funny hat. His band was tuning up. \"Who is Dizzy Gillespie?\" I asked my dad,</p><p>I'd never heard live jazz before, let alone one of its main architects. This was different. Amazing. My teen brain was now mesmerized.</p><p>Later on, a gospel and blues voice stopped me in my tracks. It was the singer-songwriter and civil rights activist Odetta. Seeger later joined her onstage for a version of \"Take This Hammer\" and the powerful song based on a Langston Hughes poem, \"Backlash Blues.\" Here was the blues like I'd never heard it before.</p><p>At Seeger's riverside musical commune you'd get to hear, and sometimes meet and chat with, musical gems including Taj Mahal, Doc Watson and scores of less well-known great musicians.</p><p>When I saw Peter Seeger perform there, several times, he had this steady charisma. His eyes sparkled with confident conviction. Seeger had a way of getting you to sing along, to sing out, to join together.</p><p>Dad was right. I did thank him later.</p><p>For me, at a Pete Seeger concert, I started to feel that maybe music could actually help create community — just might bring people together, and foster change.</p><p>And the annual festival Seeger helped found plans to continue in his spirit.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
