John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Wednesday.</p><p>Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., says the president, through his planned executive action, is trying to \"provoke\" Republicans into battle.</p><p>\"The smart thing is to find another way to deal with the president, because he's trying to pick a bar fight and start one, and that's too bad,\" Cole says.</p><p>The standoff comes as the government's budget authority is due to expire at midnight on Dec. 11.

He also plans to address the issue Friday during remarks at a Las Vegas school, the site of a speech two years ago in which he called on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration legislation. Within five months of that speech, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/immigration-bill-2013-senate-passes-93530.html\">the Senate did just that</a> â€” but the plan died in the GOP-controlled House.</p><p>You can listen to more of NPR's coverage on immigration here:  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
