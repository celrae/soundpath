The cost of violence rose nearly 4 percent from 2012.</span>\n<div class=\"large blue awesome\">$5,455 per person</div>\nThe U.S. cost of violence containment per-capita — for every man, woman, and child living in America. The U.S. spends 10.2 percent of GPD to deal with violence — everything from the costs of homicide and law enforcement, to military and terrorist threats like North Korea and Al Quaeda. The U.S. spends more per-capita than Mexico ($1,430), France ($1,300), South Africa ($1,000), Argentina ($635), or India ($145). The U.S. even outspends Israel, at $2,795 per capita, or 8.1 percent of GDP.\n<div class=\"large blue awesome\">#1: Iceland</div>\nIceland (spending $320 per person on violence containment) again ranked as the world’s most peaceful country. Iceland does well on many of the 22 indicators that the Index tracks. These include: homicide rate, terrorist activity, displaced persons due to civil conflict, per-capita weapons imports and exports, size of police and armed forces, incarceration rate, per-capita military spending, and the number killed in armed conflict. Rounding out the “Top 10 Most Peaceful” list: Denmark, Austria, New Zealand, Switzerland, Finland, Canada, Japan, Belgium, Norway.\n<div class=\"large blue awesome\">#162: Syria</div>\nSyria overtook Afghanistan in 2013 as the “least peaceful place on earth”—ranked 162 out of 162 countries surveyed. Rounding out the “10 Most Violent”: Afghanistan, South Sudan, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, and North Korea.\n<div class=\"large blue awesome\">#152 and #151: Russia, Nigeria</div>\n<span>Cutting off the “10 Most Violent” list here leaves off these two giants, which are eleven</span><span>th</span><span>&nbsp;and twelfth.
