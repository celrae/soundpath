So there&#8217;s this model of operations, it&#8217;s very joint, it&#8217;s very multi-agency and it&#8217;s basically &#8212; you&#8217;ve seen them break down the boundaries that once separated intelligence communities, special operations forces and law enforcement, to the degree to which those two rays I just talked about, there were FBI agents involved, alongside SEAL Team 6 in Somalia and Delta Force in Libya. So it&#8217;s a very effective model of operations.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the raid where al-Libi was captured</strong></p><p>&#8220;This kind of counter-terrorism model very much relies on military authorities and wartime authorities. And I see no possibility of them having, you know, give up those wartime authorities. When al-Libi, who is a member of al-Qaida and already under indictment for the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa. When they got a bead on him, they snatched him, they put him on a U.S. warship in international water, so he&#8217;s not, you know, under the legal jurisdiction of any country, and the interrogated him at length with these high-value interrogation, which are also, again, multi-agency intelligence, FBI, law enforcement. And then when that interrogation was finished, he was read his Miranda rights by the FBI guy, and at that moment, he&#8217;s accorded all the rights of any terrorist suspect in federal jurisdiction. So he was flown, at that point, to New York, where he was soon in front of a federal judge.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On concerns about this model</strong></p><p>&#8220;Critics are worried about this continued conflation of military authorities and law enforcement and criminal authorities. You know, the longer that goes on, I think, certainly civil libertarians have many concerns that you&#8217;ll just continue to erode civil liberties. The problem is coming up with an alternative, because if you go back to treating these things just as a criminal matter, you can&#8217;t go ahead and get these guys in places like Somalia or Yemen or &#8212; because they&#8217;re out of your reach. You have no jurisdiction to do anything in those countries. We are able to operate in many of those countries approval, generally, but we&#8217;re operating, generally, under wartime authorities. That&#8217;s why special operations can get involved in that. So it should be noted that, I think, 16 Americans died of terrorism last year, so it&#8217;s, you know, each one of those is a tragedy, but it&#8217;s &#8212; a whole lot more people die of gun violence in this country alone. So you would like to get to new normal, but I can&#8217;t see that new normal sort of stopping this conflation of military and law enforcement authorities in this counter-terrorism model I&#8217;ve described, because it actually works.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.defenseone.com/voices/james-kitfield/2333/\" target=\"_blank\">James Kitfield</a></strong>, contributing editor at National Journal.
