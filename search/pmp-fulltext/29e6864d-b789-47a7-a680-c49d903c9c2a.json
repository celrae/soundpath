All it took was a reunion tour — celebrating 25 years of Nickel Creek — to make it happen.</p><p>All three of the band's remarkably talented core members have been to the Tiny Desk before. Chris Thile is a veteran, having <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/137090061/chris-thile-and-michael-daves-tiny-desk-concert\">played the Tiny Desk</a> with friend and guitarist Michael Daves, then <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/142242654/yo-yo-ma-edgar-meyer-chris-thile-and-stuart-duncan-tiny-desk-concert\">later in the same year</a> with Yo-Yo Ma and others in a project known as Goat Rodeo. When The Decemberists <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/137247476/the-decemberists-tiny-desk-concert\">performed</a> a Tiny Desk Concert, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/103127675/sara-watkins\">Sara Watkins</a> was there to play her fiddle and sing. Her brother, Sean Watkins, was also at the NPR offices <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/301796818/tom-brosseau-tiny-desk-concert\">earlier this year</a> with the marvelous singer Tom Brosseau.</p><p>The trio, backed here by bassist Mark Schatz, has no equal. Nickel Creek has been doing this on and off since its members were kids, and what blows me away is the comfort and ease with which they navigate their instruments. That skill, and the creative force behind it, is a joy and a thrill to witness.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"Destination\"</li><li>\"Rest Of My Life\"</li><li>\"21st Of May\"</li><li>\"Elephant In The Corn\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Colin Marshall; Production Assistant: Maggie Starbard; photo by Sarah Tilotta/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
