So, too, will the particles along its orbit. So for the first time, we&#8217;re gonna get peppered, and it could be quite a show.&#8221;</p><p>Beatty said that predictions suggest the shower will last only a couple of hours &#8212; and fortunately for stargazers, it&#8217;ll be during the nighttime hours over North America. Peak viewing times will be 3 a.m. Saturday on the East Coast and at midnight on the West Coast. Most  of the shower will radiate from the area around Camelopardalids (Latin for giraffe) constellation, near the North Star.</p><p>Unfortunately, Beatty said, there&#8217;s no way of knowing just how grand a display it will be.</p><p>&#8220;The particles that we&#8217;re gonna see tonight are not shed by the comet recently, but 100 or 200 years ago, and we don&#8217;t know how active the comet was back then,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The prognosticators say it could be anywhere from a dud, in which case we&#8217;d just see very few, or we could see one or two a minute, or maybe five a minute &#8212; depending on, in particular, how dark your sky is. So you want to get someplace where it&#8217;s nice and dark, away from streetlights and light pollution if you can.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/about-us/j-kelly-beatty/\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Beatty</a></strong>, senior contributing editor at <a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sky & Telescope</a>.
