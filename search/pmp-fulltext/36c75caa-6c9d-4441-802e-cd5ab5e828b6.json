I find smoking disgusting. I find smoking horrible. I wish that everyone who did it could quit,\" says Emanuel. \"But I also recognize that it’s not voluntary, that most people start before they’re adults and that it’s incredibly hard to quit once you’ve started.\"<br />\n<br />\nEmanuel argues that penalties against smokers shouldn't extend to the workplace, especially in organizations like hospitals and health plans, where caring is at the core of their mission.<br />\n<br />\nEmanuel also thinks the policies open a dangerous door. \"Once you’re on this kick, you can say, ‘Look, those Seventh Day Adventists! They’re the people we really want to employ because those guys they don’t smoke, they don’t drink, they eat very healthy, they don’t engage in high-risk sporting activities.’ That just seems to me exactly where we don’t want to be going.\"<br />\n<br /></div>","audio":[{"type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"height":"340","width":"610","crop":"primary"},"href":"http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/smoker.jpg?itok=jirYiqJS"},{"format":"MP3","meta":{"api":{"type":"application/json","href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm-audio:/marketplace/segments/2013/04/17/marketplace_segment16_20130417"},"duration_hms":"00:05:25","duration":325},"href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/marketplace/segments/2013/04/17/marketplace_segment16_20130417_64.mp3","type":"audio/mpeg"}]}
