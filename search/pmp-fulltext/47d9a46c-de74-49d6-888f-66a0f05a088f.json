Now, the algorithm has rendered its judgment.","itags":["npr_api","409746236"],"guid":"47d9a46c-de74-49d6-888f-66a0f05a088f","contentencoded":"<p>Nearly a thousand of you heeded our call on All Tech Considered to submit a voice sample. The idea: Let a computer algorithm decide if you have a voice for radio.</p><p>Now, we've got the results.</p><p>Actor Wilbur Fitzgerald rated highly (surprise, surprise):</p><p>But most of you who responded are not actors. And it turns out, you don't need professional training to impress man or machine.</p><p>Back in March, NPR reporter Aarti Shahani <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/03/23/394827451/now-algorithms-are-deciding-whom-to-hire-based-on-voice\">looked at a company called Jobaline</a>. It creates software to assess the voices of job candidates for potential employers. CEO Luis Salazar says it's one additional metric along with things like experience and education.</p><p>For instance, a call center dealing with angry customers wants employees with nice, soothing voices. Retailers, on the other hand, want energetic voices to push merchandise.</p><p>We wondered how well the software works. So Salazar gave us a custom analysis looking for both characteristics.</p><p>He tells NPR: \"This was a very interesting exercise. You want somebody who's engaging because it's a radio show, but you want something soothing, which seems to be the key characteristic of hosts of NPR.\"</p><p>Thanks, we'll take that.<br /> <br />And here are a few of the audience voices the computer algorithm ranked the highest. See if you agree.</p><p>Now, we have to admit, we were also struck by the voices that the computer did <em>not </em>rank as highly. According to our human ears, some of these low-scoring voices sounded pretty darn good. Take this one:</p><p>Salazar says he actually likes that one too, though he's not sure it's very soothing. \"It's maybe the energy level,\" he says. \"I think it would be a great voice for reading [an] audio book.\"</p><p>Bruce Raby, what do you think? A future in audio-book narration?</p><p>Ultimately, Salazar says there still has to be a human element here. Real people also judge these outcomes, and help the software get better.</p><p>Our thanks to all who put their best voice forward.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
