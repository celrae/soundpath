The youth are the folks who have often the highest level of education in the family, even if it's only ninth or 10th grade. They're English-proficient and they don't have ambiguous legal status. And, so, if you're trying to figure out how to make ends meet, that seems like a really rational choice.</p><p><strong>On what causes kids from immigrant families to fall behind</strong></p><p>You know, kids start school behind in preschool because of language issues and other things, but they do remarkably well in elementary school. They're on par with their peers. And that's really a testament to the great way that these families wrap around these kids and support them when they're little, right? But the problem is that there's such a steep drop-off when you get to middle school, and then high school they face these pressures — I think there are just a lot of really strong economic realities.</p><p><strong>On how to prevent youths in immigrant families from falling behind</strong></p><p>In the policy world we're talking a lot about whole family approaches. You know, in this case, that's a very appropriate way to think about this problem — that it's not just the kid in isolation but, you know, the family, and having sort of resource-sufficiency. Interventions with the parents themselves for education and training as well as figuring out how you help families meet some of those basic needs could be really helpful.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
