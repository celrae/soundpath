You know, it’s not, this is not a comedy by any means.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Aaron Aites:</strong> But in some ways I feel like a doll treatment might be <em>less</em> harrowing and <em>more</em> friendly to someone watching it who really wants to know the story, than actually seeing that acted out on the screen.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Audrey Ewell:</strong> It’s kind of amazing.&nbsp; And actually, something that I love about it is that you actually cannot access this film without looking for it. It was pulled — the Carpenter family sued and had it pulled because of licensing issues.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Aaron Aites:</strong> It’s always a thrill when you have to seek out something, and then you eventually get it, and it’s fantastic.</p>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br />\n<h2>2. “La Jetée” by&nbsp;Chris Marker</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Audrey Ewell:</strong> Another filmmaker that I love who works in experimental is Chris Marker. I’m gonna choose, from him, “La Jetée,” which was later made into Terry Gilliam’s film “12 Monkeys.”</p>\n<br />\n<p>It’s a short film; it was made almost entirely using still photographs. It’s a really fascinating story that involves time travel… and I don’t want to give too much away, but it’s about the way that a person’s death can mark their life. I’ve probably said too much already.</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ezkAeQuUqCg\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Aaron Aites:</strong> It’s a very… it’s an exceedingly lyrical film where one moment of motion footage of a woman opening her eyes has the impact of a nuclear bomb.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Audrey Ewell:</strong> Oh, that’s good!</p>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br />\n<h2>3. “Sherman’s March”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Aaron Aites:</strong> Our third film is Ross McElwee’s “Sherman’s March.”&nbsp; Which is ostensibly about Sherman’s Civil War march through the South, but McElwee suffered a traumatic breakup with his girlfriend before filming and had a hard time leaving that behind.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Audrey Ewell:</strong> So as he’s going on this journey through the South, following Sherman’s actual march, he’s also running into all of his ex-girlfriends and trying to figure out from them just what went wrong.&nbsp; And it’s hilarious.</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/RnohMWYXeZ4\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Aaron Aites:</strong> And occasionally he’ll say, “And by the way, Sherman came through here.” It’s only tangentially about Sherman’s March.
