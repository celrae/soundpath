So go for it.' ”</p>\n<p>The song was Portnoy’s first big break. It also happened to be the most successful thing he’s ever done. Portnoy says his license plate actually reads: 1HIT1DR.</p>\n<p>But that's not such a bad thing. Portnoy gets paid every time the song plays. In recent years, the song has been licensed for commercials — selling cars, Dr. Pepper and even insurance. He won’t say how much he has made off this one song. But he will say that it’s enough to live off of. Portnoy is now 59; he says he enjoys a simple life outside of New York City where he collects Japanese Maples and mid-Century studio pottery.

Wolff stopped taking calls from Hollywood and started coaching little league.</p>\n<p>“We decided that we were going to challenge this notion that there’s no such thing as enough money,” Wolff says. “We decided how ever many marbles there are in 2005, that’s what we’re going to leave with.”</p>\n<p>How those royalties are calculated is a complicated business. There are whole organizations that specialize in tracking, collecting and distributing royalties for songwriters.</p>\n<p>“I think the simplest thing to say is the more often it’s played, the better,” Grier says. “And if it goes into syndication, then it just becomes a constant flow of royalties.”</p>\n<p>So that’s what happens when you’re hired to write a song. But what happens when you get that call — a television network wants to use your band’s little-known song for their TV theme? That’s what happened to Brett and Rennie Sparks, the husband-wife duo behind the Handsome Family.</p>\n<p>“We were surprised, that’s for sure,” Brett says. “I think we initially deleted the email thinking it was some kind of joke.”</p>\n<p>The Handsome Family released the song “Far From Any Road” in 2003. About a decade later, HBO used the song as the theme of the&nbsp;first season of \"True Detective.\" It was never considered one of the band’s more popular tunes, but since airing repeatedly on HBO, Rennie estimates the song has earned more than all their other songs combined.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p4zluA60hjs\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest benefit of all this exposure: Tons of new fans.

If it were, it’s fair to say HBO would have had to pay <em>a lot</em> more. Entertainment lawyer Josh Grier says to license a popular contemporary song, a TV network would probably have to pay six-figures.
