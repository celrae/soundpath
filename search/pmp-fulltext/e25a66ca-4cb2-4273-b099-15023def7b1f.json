He&nbsp;says the judge&#39;s decision shocked many South Africans.</span></p><p>&ldquo;A lot of people [in South Africa are] quite disturbed by this acquittal on murder,&quot; he says, &quot;because everybody saw Pistorius on the witness stand. And they saw what the judge herself said today, which was that he was evasive, he was a poor witness and he was untruthful on some points. He was argumentative and debating. He came off as quite arrogant and quite sorry for himself. People saw that and they didn&rsquo;t have a high opinion of him after that.&rdquo;</p><p>Judge Masipa&nbsp;rejected the argument that Pistorius felt &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; because of his disability and that he was traumatized by growing up in a country with a high crime rate.&nbsp;&quot;Vulnerability is not unique. There are many people in this country without any form of security at all,&quot; she said. Still, after the murder acquittal, several South African legal experts publicly questioned the verdict.&nbsp;</p><p>York says the trial has become an example of <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/judge-from-humblest-beginnings-to-decide-fate-of-oscar-pistorius/article20487372/\">how much South Africa has changed</a> since the end of apartheid.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&quot;We have a judge who grew up in poverty in Soweto township and fought her way up from a really difficult background,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, she&rsquo;s sitting in judgment over a very wealthy, powerful, celebrity white athlete.
