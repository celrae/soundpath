Fans of the Winnipeg Jets are heartbroken; Chicago Blackhawk lovers are feeling great.</p><p>But you don't need to be an NHL superfan to find something fascinating about hockey. A.J. Jacobs, an editor-at-large for <em>Esquire </em>and a professional know-it-all, joined NPR's Scott Simon to talk about quirky facts from the sport's past and present.</p><p>How much hockey trivia do <em>you</em> know? Take a guess at which of the facts below are true, then hit \"play\" to see if you were right.</p><hr /><p><strong>What important element of hockey was establishe</strong><strong>d at the very first official indoor hockey game?</strong></p><p>Did the very first game enter sudden-death overtime? Did the players immediately decide to grow a bushy playoff beard? Or did the game descend into a brawl?</p><p><strong>What food items were repurposed as early hockey pucks?</strong></p><p>One of the earliest hockey pucks was frankly unpleasant: cow dung. Cut-up lacrosse balls and wooden pucks were also common. But so was at least one edible item.</p><p>What foodstuff was used on the ice: hardtack biscuits, potatoes or pork chops?</p><p><strong>What foul things did audiences famously throw onto the ice?</strong></p><p>Rats, hats, pizza, hamburgers, teddy bears, shoes ... fans are famous for throwing all of those onto the ice. But the most famous projectile is not for the squeamish.</p><p>What, as NPR's Scott Simon notes, did one group of fans regularly toss on the ice: dog feces, dead octopuses, live cockroaches or rotten eggs?</p><p><strong>What has the Stanley Cup been up to?</strong></p><p>The Cup itself, which is awarded to the NHL's top team, has been around the block a few times.</p><p>In fact, it's better to ask what the 122-year-old Stanley Cup <em>hasn't</em> been up to. Take a guess as to which of these experiences the Stanley Cup has not (yet) had:</p><ul><li>Swimming underwater</li><li>Hosting a baptism</li><li>Being wielded as a weapon</li><li>Feeding a dog</li><li>Visiting a strip club</li><li>Serving as a toilet</li></ul><p><strong>And finally, what happened in some of hockey's most epic bouts on the ice?</strong></p><p>There are no bonus points for knowing that hockey games often end in brawls. But which of the following actually happened: a player trying to start a fire, a fan being beaten with his own shoe, or a player's hairpiece being ripped off midfight?  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
