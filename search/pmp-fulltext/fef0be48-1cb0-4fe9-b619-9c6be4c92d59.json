The Nobel, the National Book Awards shortlists, and the Man Booker Prize were all recently announced.

It was definitely a Crabtree kind of night.\"</p><p>That, my friends, is one of those lines for which books were invented. For which <em>awards</em> were invented — to bestow temporary graces upon those lurching, bourbon-sodden romantics and idiots who believe that a life spent telling stories for nickels is worthwhile.</p><p>I am one of those idiots. And so is Michael Chabon, who wrote the lines above as a kind of mid-chapter mike-drop in his novel <em>Wonder Boys</em>. Lots of other lines surrounded it. Many of them were nearly as good because Chabon is a guy to whom, it sometimes seems, the good lines just come like gifts.</p><p>The book's main character is Grady Tripp. And it's <em>professor </em>Grady Tripp, actually, a one-time blazing, bright star of the book world now an old writer, perpetually stoned, teaching writing at some literarily perfect little liberal arts college in Pittsburgh and too scattered in a hundred different ways to finish his second book. His foil is, of course, a young writer. A student named James Leer. He's a mopey, damaged, proto-emo goof who speaks in a \"choked little powder-soft voice,\" but is also a wickedly talented, capable of churning out brilliant short stories overnight and entire novels over the course of a couple months. And then there's Grady's editor, Crabtree, in town to get his hands on the manuscript of Grady's next book — a rambling mess of a thing currently clocking in at 2,611 pages.</p><p>And <em>Wonder Boys</em> is a book about precisely them — about old writers and young writers and people who care deeply about words and book awards even if their sadness lives in their suspicions that maybe no one else does.</p><p>In the long, deep and generally awful canon of writers writing books about writers and books, <em>Wonder Boys</em> is my favorite by a hard mile. And if that sounds like faint praise (<em>Hey! You're the best of all the crap!</em>), it isn't, because the genius of <em>Wonder Boys</em> is in the way it walks a knife-edge between being a serious meditation on the whiskey and weed filled, quietly lonely and sadly desperate lives of writers and Northeastern academics, and an out-and-out farce gut-ripping that same preciousness. Everyone is drunk in <em>Wonder Boys</em>. Or stoned. Or both. James shoots a dog. Crabtree steals that tuba. There's even a car chase. Of sorts.</p><p>And while it would be perfect to be able to say that <em>Wonder Boys </em>went on to win some heavy, important award, it wouldn't be true.</p><p>No, Michael Chabon would have to wait a few years for that. For <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay </em>which won him the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2001.</p><p><em>Jason Sheehan is an ex-chef, a former restaurant critic and the current food editor of </em><a href=\"http://www.phillymag.com/\">Philadelphia</a> <em>magazine.
