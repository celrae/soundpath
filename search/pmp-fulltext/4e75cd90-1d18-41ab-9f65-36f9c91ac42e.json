He's incorporated elements of all four styles into his new album, <em>Call Me Insane</em>.</p><p>No matter what you call it, though, Watson's music is filled with autobiographical experiences and real-life characters. One song on <em>Call Me Insane</em>, \"Burden Of The Cross,\" finds Watson grappling with the death of a girlfriend in a car accident.</p><p>\"I went through years of grief and didn't know how to deal with it,\" Watson says. \"But they put up a cross where the accident happened, and I would always visit that. It was therapeutic for me to be able to see it and to go to it. And they widened the road there on [Texas State Highway] 71 ... and they moved the cross, and it bothered me. So I had to go back out there and put it back up.\"</p><p>Another song from the new album, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9fJnYQRw8I\" target=\"_blank\">Heaven's Gonna Have A Honky Tonk</a>,\" addresses mortality somewhat more lightheartedly. If the song's title is true, Watson knows who his drinking buddies will be in the afterlife.</p><p>\"I'm gonna be sitting out there listening to George Jones, Hank Williams, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, Kitty Wells and Tammy Wynette, while I'm drinking a celestial beer,\" he says.</p><p>Hear Watson's full conversation with NPR's Scott Simon at the audio link above.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
