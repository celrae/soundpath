Issues surrounding the highway include NIMBY-ism, bureaucratic tangles, haves vs. have nots, regional politics and lots and lots of money. Marketplace’s Kai Ryssdal explains. Plus: as a part of \"The Weak Link\" series, we also take a look at the aging cast iron water pipes under the streets of Los Angeles. Many are corroding and they're dangerously vulnerable in big earthquakes.

Quake-prone Japan has been manufacturing and installing them for 40 years now but they're rare in the U.S.  The L.A. Department of Water and Power is now trying them out as part of a pilot project.
