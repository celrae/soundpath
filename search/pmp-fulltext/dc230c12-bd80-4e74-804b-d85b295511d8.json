According to a <a href=\"http://detroitsevenpointtwo.com/resources/sevenpointtwosquaremilesfullreport.pdf\">report</a> prepared earlier this year, per-capita income is $20,216. That’s well below the average for cities like Minneapolis that have seen a revival of their urban cores.</p>\n<p>“A lot of cities have already undergone this change,” says Kurt Metzger, a demographer with Data Driven Detroit who worked on the report.</p>\n<p>Metzger says the wealth picture in greater downtown does not jibe with the image of your typical Whole Foods customer. “It’s driven by a lot of elderly people, still a lot of single-room occupancy hotels and some lower-income folks, plus you’ve got college students” who are not exactly high-income earners, says Metzger. “So when you look at the data the income mix is pretty low. It’s one of the lower income neighborhoods in the city.”</p>\n<p>But Metzger says anecdotally, things do seem to be on a trajectory that indicates greater wealth could be on the way. For one thing, Metzger says, downtown is starting to attract new white residents. To a demographer, that often signals higher incomes and education. But Metzger knows that for some folks, a sudden influx of new white residents can also mean the g-word.</p>\n<p>“There’s this fear of gentrification,” Metzger said. “We’re a long way from there.”</p>\n<p>And even if, or when, this part of Detroit catches up with places like downtown Pittsburgh or Minneapolis, some perspective is in order.</p>\n<p>“Let’s realize that yeah this is great, but this is 7.2 square miles in a city that’s 139 square miles,” Metzger said.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Retail ground zero\"</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But look around Midtown at all the new shops, restaurants and construction projects and it’s hard not to be optimistic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One big thing Midtown has going for it is its daytime population. Sue Mosey of Midtown Inc. puts the number of employees and students in the area on any given day at 50,000. Those are 50,000 people who need lunch every day, and maybe some cufflinks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I’m Joe Posch and we’re at <a href=\"http://thankhugh.blogspot.com/\">Hugh</a>, which is a store inspired by classic bachelor pad style in Midtown Detroit,” says the owner of one of many new retail shops in Midtown. Hugh stocks cocktail accessories, personal effects, fancy men’s grooming gear, housewares and furniture. And Posch says he’s met his sales goals each month he’s been open.</p>\n<p>“This is just, for me, retail ground zero for Detroit,” said Posch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/field_images/2013/06/The%20Ellington_0.jpg?itok=EtKyBXpt\" alt=\"\" /><em>The Ellington is one of the more upscale lofts in Midtown.&nbsp; Rents here go as high as $1,600 per month.(John Ketchum/Marketplace)</em></span></p>\nBut Posch, who lives in the city, is a realist when it comes to Midtown’s good fortunes rubbing off on the rest of Detroit.
