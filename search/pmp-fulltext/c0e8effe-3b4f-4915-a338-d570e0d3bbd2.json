Humor is always about a wound.&#8221;</p><p>Dunham said she could not have written her book without prior feminist trailblazers, like Nora Ephron and Helen Gurley Brown, the founder of Cosmopolitan.</p><p>&#8220;I hope that those women would feel excited and feel that I was continuing a dialogue that they very bravely started,&#8221; Dunham said. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s better for young women than reading books by great women from the last 150 years.&#8221;</p><p><strong> &#8220;I&#8217;m 20 years old and I hate myself&#8221;</p><p></strong></p><p>The book begins, &#8220;I&#8217;m 20 years old and I hate myself.&#8221;</p><p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"\">Women should be able to feel safe and comfortable on their own campuses, and college experimentation should not lead to lifelong trauma.<div class=\"pullquoteauth\">&ndash; Lena Dunham</div></div></span></p><p>&#8220;It continues to be a very raw experience,&#8221; Dunham said of reading the book out loud on the tour. &#8220;Every time I read, I relive the painful stuff that&#8217;s in the pages. I don&#8217;t have as much distance as one might hope.&#8221;</p><p>Dunham is 29 years old now, and says writing the book has helped her to understand her younger self.</p><p>&#8220;When I read what it was like to be a younger version of myself, I feel a lot of sympathy, I sometimes feel enraged with her,&#8221; Dunham said. &#8220;Writing the book has been cathartic and caused me to make some kind of peace with that.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Women in college</strong></p><p>One of the essays in Dunham&#8217;s book is about being sexually assaulted in college.</p><p>&#8220;It took me a long time to become comfortable with the idea that I had been involved in a non-consensual sexual experience,&#8221; Dunham said. &#8220;Like so many women, I took a lot of the blame for it &#8230; I know some people will object to the idea that I didn&#8217;t name it, but to me it was important to explore how many women have experiences that they can&#8217;t name, and they don&#8217;t know where to file it. What I concluded was that it had been traumatic, and I needed to admit to myself how traumatic it had been in order to be able to move on.&#8221;</p><p>Dunham says she hopes the national conversation about campus sexual violence causes men to examine themselves.</p><p>&#8220;Women should be able to feel safe and comfortable on their own campuses, and college experimentation should not lead to lifelong trauma,&#8221; Dunham said. &#8220;Women are forced to take responsibility for themselves and their own safety in a way men never are.&#8221;</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://lenadunham.com/events/\" target=\"_blank\">Tour Dates</a></li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://lenadunham.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Lena Dunham, </strong></a>actor and creator of the HBO series &#8220;Girls.&#8221; Her new book of essays is &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Not-That-Kind-Girl-Learned/dp/081299499X/?tag=wburorg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Not That Kind of Girl</a>.&#8221; She tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lenadunham\" target=\"_blank\">@lenadunham</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
