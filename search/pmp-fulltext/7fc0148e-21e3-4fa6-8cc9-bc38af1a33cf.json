Then we play an equally reflective new song from singer Jenny Lewis (<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/14984051/rilo-kiley\">Rilo Kiley</a>, Jenny & Johnny) called \"Just One of the Guys,\" an ode to growing old and trying to find your place in the world.</p><p>Later, we've got a killer new dance track from the Amsterdam electronic producer Shinedoe that features singer Karin Dreijer (<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15793896/the-knife\">The Knife</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/106987812/fever-ray\">Fever Ray</a>), as well as a trance-inducing song from classically trained composer and producer Craig Leon. Both songs come courtesy of NPR Music's Sami Yenigun and Otis Hart, curators of our <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2014/06/02/312539008/recommended-dose-the-best-dance-tracks-of-may\">Recommended Dose</a> feature; it's a monthly mix of the best dance and electronic music.</p><p>Also on the show: The Canadian psych-rock group Elephant Stone returns with a sitar-powered song that was surely inspired by the 1966 Beatles cut \"Tomorrow Never Knows.\" Plus, My Brightest Diamond, the musical project of singer Shara Worden, returns with \"Pressure,\" a stirring song powered by an incredible drumline.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
