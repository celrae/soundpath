But Monfils appears to be as much of an entertainer as he is a player. Even as he heads to the quarterfinals against Roger Federer, it's his antics and on-court dancing that seem to endear him to the crowds.","contentencoded":"<p>Historians think tennis was invented in France, so maybe that&#39;s why Frenchman Gaël Monfils is so comfortable &mdash; some tennis fans say <em>too</em> comfortable &mdash; playing the game.</p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Monfils is one of the most colorful characters to grace the courts at the US Open in a while.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">The 28-year-old electrifies the crowds with both his game and his showman&#39;s antics.</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&ldquo;A lot of people say he&rsquo;s more interested in being an entertainer than he is in being a tennis player, an</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">d that&rsquo;s fairly accurate</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">,&rdquo; says tennis writer Ricky Dimon. &ldquo;Sometimes he goes out there </span><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO3IQtW8Dlc\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">dancing </span></a><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\"><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO3IQtW8Dlc\">during changeovers</a>&nbsp;and sometimes even in between points.&rdquo;</span></p><p>So while he&#39;s a hit with fans at the US Open, Dimon thinks he&#39;s unlikely to win the tournament: &quot;H<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">e&rsquo;s been more interested in putting on a show than he has in winning tournaments, or even Grand Slams, which he certainly has the potential to do.&quot;</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">In some ways, says Dimon this makes Monfils a frustrating player to watch, &ldquo;because we know he could be so good. But at the same time it also makes him an amazing player to watch, because he is so entertaining.&rdquo; </span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Even beyond his dance moves &mdash; he claims Beyonce is his</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&nbsp;current inspiration &mdash; </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Monfils has earned the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">nickname &quot;Sliderman&quot; for the way he throws his body all over the court. It&#39;s an exhilarating but injury-prone style: Monfils was ranked seventh in the world in 2011 but <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/18/sport/tennis/tennis-monfils-injury/index.html\">has lost significant</a> <a href=\"http://www.espn.co.uk/tennis/sport/story/134901.html\">time to injuries</a> since then</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Now Monfils has fought his way to the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows, where he will face the legendary Swiss machine that is Roger Federer. Federer&#39;s calm, consistent style is a stark contrast to Montfils&#39; anything-goes presence on the court.</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Monfils has the talent to take on Federer,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Dimon says &mdash;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&nbsp;but he&#39;ll have to leave the showmanship at home.</span></p>","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/RTR44PB1.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/rtr44pb1jpg"}]}
