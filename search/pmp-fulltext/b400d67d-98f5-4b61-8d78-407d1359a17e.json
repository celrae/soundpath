Marketplace's Steve Tripoli says it just goes to show how developing countries are becoming big players in the growth of some Western businesses.\n<hr />\n<strong>STEVE TRIPOLI:</strong> Skype officials say China's now a main driver of their business. And users across Asia now account for 30 percent of Skype's customer base, up from 20 percent just a year ago.<br />\n<br />\nTryggvi Thayer at the University of Minnesota says this is an example of how developing countries often skip a generation of technology as they enter markets.\n<blockquote><strong>TRYGGVI THAYER:</strong> Basically it's a game of catching up, but they're able to catch up quicker.</blockquote>\nThayer says swift moves to several top-flight technologies help poorer countries narrow the economic gap with wealthier ones. He says new telecomm technologies are just one example.\n<blockquote><strong>THAYER:</strong> These can sort of jumpstart development in developing countries, because these developing countries won't have to go through the process of laying land lines.</blockquote>\nIt isn't only in telecomm.
