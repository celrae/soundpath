For his latest album, the newly minted NEA Jazz Master worked in two old European instruments.","itags":["npr_api","400430705"],"guid":"ca30a6c9-559e-4812-a50a-686d4d583b14","contentencoded":"<p>Jazz musician and composer Charles Lloyd has what you might call an \"eclectic\" resume.</p><p>The saxophonist has played with hundreds of jazz musicians — but also B.B. King, the Beach Boys, tabla master Zakir Hussain.</p><p>Tonight, Charles Lloyd will be inducted as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master. He's being honored, in part, for fusing jazz with musical styles from other places and times.</p><p>You can hear that on his new album, <em>Wild Man Dance</em>, which features two ancient instruments from Europe.</p><p>\"I decided that I wanted to have strings,\" Lloyd says. \"But I wanted to have the strings of a cimbalom and the lyra.\"</p><p>The cimbalom is a kind of dulcimer, but huge. Its strings stretch over a big wooden box, and are hit with long padded hammers. On the album, it's played by Miklós Lukács.</p><p>\"I heard this many years ago when I played a festival in Hungary,\" Lloyd says. \"It was being played at my hotel after the concert by a gypsy orchestra, and I just loved its sonority so much.\"</p><p>Lloyd also brings in the Greek lyra, performed by Sokratis Sinopoulos.</p><p>\"It sounds sort of like a violin but it has the beauty and the wisdom of antiquity,\" Lloyd say. \"So I was trying to mix antiquity with modernity, is what's going on here.\"</p><p>Lloyd wrote the music on <em>Wild Man Dance</em> for the Jazztopad festival in Wroclaw, Poland, where he performed and recorded those compositions. He was inspired — he says — by the lush landscape.</p><p>\"There was lots of greenery, there were lots of trees,\" he says. \"It was like a poetic kind of environment for me. Once I started composing the music, I couldn't stop. It just gushed forth.\"</p><p>Now 77, Charles Lloyd describes himself as a \"sound seeker.\"</p><p>\"The deeper I go in the music, the further I still have to go,\" he says. \"It's like the creator has a carrot on a stick, you know, and I get closer and then he keeps moving it and he says, 'Not yet, Charles.'\"</p><p>After Lloyd receives his NEA Jazz Master award, he'll be premiering the <em>Wild Man Dance</em> suite for American audiences this month.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
