What we can learn now.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson wrote the radical document at the heart of the American experiment.  The Declaration of Independence.  “All men are created equal.”  And he kept slaves.  He argued mightily against a too-powerful central government, and he led the federal government as the nation’s third president. He was a planter, a scientist, an historian, an Enlightenment-smitten philosopher, and – says biographer Jon Meacham – a surpassing politician.  With a flexibility that our politicians today could use.

Even though I know quite a lot about Jefferson, I was repeatedly surprised by the fresh information Meacham brings to his work. Surely there is not a significant detail out there, in any pertinent archive, that he has missed.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/11/06/what-would-thomas-jefferson-think-of-election-day-2012/\">The Wall Street Journal</a> &#8220;For Election Day, we asked some leading historians and bestselling biographers what the Founding Fathers would have thought about this year’s presidential campaign between President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney.&#8221;</p><h4>Note: Our Sample Copyright Exemption Has Expired Since This Program First Aired in 2012</h4>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
