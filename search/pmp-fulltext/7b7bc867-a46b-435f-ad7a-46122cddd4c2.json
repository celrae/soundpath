And the nation has taken notice. The outpouring of support for the library has reached \"orders of magnitude\" more than any previous amount, says library Director Scott Bonner.</p><p>He's the only full-time librarian there â€” and he started his job in July, just weeks before the town became an internationally known name. Bonner says the donations may allow him to hire another person to help.</p><p>For community leaders and business owners, the library has become a place to convene.</p><p>\"Whenever businesses have been hit, North County Incorporated needed a meeting space, and I said, of course, yes. Small Business Administration came in and did staging of emergency loans out of the library,\" Bonner says. \"When there's a need, we try to find a way to meet it. I have a very broad definition of librarianship.\"</p><p>Since the latest unrest began Monday night, more than $175,000 has poured in. More than 7,000 people had given something as of Wednesday afternoon, many in $5 and $10 amounts. Donations so far this week are 10 times what they were during protests in August.</p><p>It all started with a few tweets from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fergusonlibrary\">the library's account</a>, which Bonner's wife helps with in her free time.</p><p>\"Before I knew it, [there were] thousands of tweets with encouragements to donate, including retweets from people such as Neil Gaiman and LeVar Burton,\" Bonner said.</p><p>With the donations this week, Bonner plans to purchase more \"healing kits\" for children to check out. The kits include books about dealing with traumatic events and a stuffed animal that they can keep.</p><p>The level of support the library has seen this week can buy even more than healing kits.</p><p>\"It means we can do a whole lot more programming that's focused on the community, [and] long overdue updates to the library. We have infrastructure needs that should have been taken care of 10 years ago. But what I really hope I can do is to get a full-time children's or programming librarian,\" Bonner says.</p><p>\"No matter how much I work,\" he says, \"it's not anywhere what a dedicated person who thinks about community all the time can do.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
