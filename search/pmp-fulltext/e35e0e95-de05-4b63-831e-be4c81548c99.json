But in the 1960s, her poetry of twenty and thirty before attracted new audiences, which rekindled her creativity in her last years. In the hour to come, biographer Margot Peters will tell us about the choices Niedecker made and how they affected the poet's life and writing.","itags":["npr_api","375243657"],"contentencoded":"<p><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 MPX.
