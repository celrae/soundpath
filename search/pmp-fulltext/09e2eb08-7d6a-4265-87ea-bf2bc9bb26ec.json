NPR's Leah Scarpelli spoke with the three members on the occasion of the new album </em>No Cities to Love<em>, out today. Hear her piece at the audio link, and read on for a few moments that didn't make the broadcast.</em></p><hr /><p><em></em><strong>Corin Tucker On Finding Her Singing Voice</strong></p><p>\"I wanted to sing, and I think that I wanted to be in a band, but there just wasn't really the opportunity until I got to Olympia. Right after I got there, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/106311747/bikini-kill\" target=\"_blank\">Bikini Kill</a> and Bratmobile played their first show and I was like, 'That's it, that's what I'm going to do!' I started my first band, Heavens to Betsy, and I had kind of more of a sing-song voice when I first started that band. But because it was the '90s and grunge was ruling the world, I started experimenting with really loud guitar and much more aggressive vocals — just trying to get people's attention with the music. So yeah, there's a lot of howling on those early records.\"</p><p><strong>Carrie Brownstein On Having Famous Fans</strong></p><p>\"Gerard Way of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15396987/my-chemical-romance\" target=\"_blank\">My Chemical Romance</a> is a huge fan of our band, and I think he's awesome. I think he's a good songwriter and singer, and I like his relationship to his fans. He covered 'I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone,' which is one of our early songs. And <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/167801992/perfume-genius\" target=\"_blank\">Perfume Genius</a>, which is an artist who I love and whose record is one of my favorites of [2014], said he'd seen Sleater-Kinney 13 times. You kind of just never know. People find different ways into this band and different reasons to appreciate it.\"</p><p><strong>Janet Weiss On The Thrill Of Playing Live</strong></p><p>\"As a drummer, I think it's the best place to be heard. A practice space is just brutal for the people who have to listen to the drummer. The studio can be very difficult — with headphones, and you're sort of trying to make things sound a certain way and it's very challenging. But live, where there is air and there is energy from the crowd, I think that energy can elevate what I do to a new level. I'm sort of recreating that in my mind, I think, when I play on a record or when I play at practice. In the right situation on stage, I feel more like a superhero than any other time in my life.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
