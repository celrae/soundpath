But here's what researchers believe might happen. MERS circulates in dromedary camels in the Middle East, making them sick every now and then. When people work with a sick animal — or perhaps drink its milk — they may catch the virus. Then if an infected person seeks medical help, MERS can spread to dozens of people because the virus flourishes in hospitals.</p><p>Eventually all those cases get contained, and that distinct outbreak comes to an end.</p><p>But then another restless MERS virus makes the jump from camels to people, and the whole outbreak cycle starts all over again.</p><p>Until scientists figure out exactly how camels pass MERS to people, Pallansch says, more outbreaks will pop up.</p><p>\"As long as there is continual exposure to whatever animal source for MERS exists in the Arabian Peninsula, we will always continue to have sporadic cases,\" Pallansch says.</p><p>And those cases could turn up anywhere on the globe.</p><p>The current outbreak in Korea shows the MERS virus' ability to hitch a ride on a commercial airline and then cause havoc once it lands. This past week, the U.S. CDC just issued <a href=\"http://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00380.asp\">updated guidance</a> to doctors, warning them to be on the lookout for MERS in patients who've recently traveled to the Middle East or Korea.</p><p>The Korean outbreak grew so dramatically in part because doctors were slow to recognize the first case as MERS, says <a href=\"http://www.foodsafetydubai.com/speaker-details.aspx?id=12\">Peter Ben Embarek</a>, head of the World Health Organization's MERS Task Force.</p><p>As with any outbreak, cultural factors also fueled the spread of the virus, he says. \"There is a habit in Korea of when you go to a doctor or hospital, you go and see several hospitals, in the days after, if you feel the need for a second opinion,\" he says.</p><p>And that's exactly what happened in this outbreak.</p><p>Also, families are often very attentive to loved ones when they're hospitalized, which could have put more people at risk of exposure to the virus.</p><p>There's no vaccine or specific treatment for MERS. Embarek says the most promising potential weapon against the disease is a camel vaccine. Rather than try to address MERS directly in humans, the idea would be to stop the virus at a source.</p><p>Some vaccine trials are in the works, he adds, but it could be years before there's a viable solution.</p><p>\"In this type of work, developing vaccine takes time,\" Embarek says. \"For the time being, unfortunately, we won't have a vaccine at hand.\"</p><p>So, in the meantime, doctors around the world are going to have to be on heightened alert for this deadly disease.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
