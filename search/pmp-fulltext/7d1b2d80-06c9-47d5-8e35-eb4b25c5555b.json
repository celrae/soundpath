Each narrowed that enormous list down to just a few songs by previously unknown bands that they're now planning to check out in Austin. NPR Music's Frannie Kelley and Ann Powers also stop by to offer a couple of suggestions, along with Katie Presley, music writer for <a href=\"http://bitchmagazine.org/profile/katiepresley\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bitch Media</em></a> and NPR Music.</p><p>Discovery is the name of the game for many at SXSW, and this show is all about up-and-coming talent. Whether it's the upbeat, celebratory feel of Louisiana's Royal Teeth or the ghostly experimental electronic music of Alligator Indian, this edition of <em>All Songs Considered</em> is bursting with passion and unique voices. Hopefully we'll uncover a lot more of that feeling this week in Austin.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
