National security expert <strong>Richard Clarke</strong>, who recently served on President Obama&#8217;s task force that recommended changes on NSA surveillance programs, told <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now</a></em> host Jeremy Hobson that messages sent over apps like WhatsApp, iMessage and Facetime cannot be deciphered by the government.</p><p>&#8220;If you talk about FaceTime and iMessaging, those are both encrypted by Apple, and therefore the government cannot intercept them,&#8221; Clarke said. &#8220;And Apple says it&#8217;s designed the systems in such a way that even Apple can&#8217;t decrypt them. This has caused the FBI to ask the White House to change the law so that they can compel a &#8216;back door&#8217; in encryption. But right now, Apple says there is no such back door, and even Apple, if it were given a warrant, couldn&#8217;t give the government access to FaceTime or iMessaging.&#8221;</p><p>Clarke believes that government investigators have other tracking tools and should not have the ability to decipher the encrypted Internet messages of private citizens. He says there&#8217;s &#8220;great value&#8221; in citizens having the right &#8220;to communicate without the government snooping on them.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.goodharbor.net/team/clarke.php\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Clarke</a></strong>, national security expert.
