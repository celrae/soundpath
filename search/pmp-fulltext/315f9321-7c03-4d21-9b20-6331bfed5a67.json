But it is possible to bet in the opposite direction. You can bet against a stock, hoping it will plunge. It's called \"shorting\" a stock.</p><p>Most people don't short stocks, and we wondered why. So we decided to short something ourselves.</p><p>We had no idea what to short, or how to do it. So we asked the well-known short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research for advice. He interrupted me before I could finish explaining our plan.</p><p>\"Don't do it,\" he said.</p><p>It turns out that shorting is not just the opposite of buying a stock. Left rattled off three reasons why we should give up.</p><ol><li><strong>\"You could lose an infinite amount of money.\" </strong>If you buy a stock for $10, the most you can lose is $10. A stock can't go any lower than zero. But if you short a stock, you can lose a lot more. A $10 stock can shoot up to $50, or $100, or $200. The more it goes up, the more you lose.</li><li><strong>\"The forces of Wall Street are against you.\" </strong>Over time the stock market tends to go up, not down. By shorting something you are swimming against the current.</li><li><strong>People will hate you. </strong>Betting that a company's stock will drop can make you unpopular. Left says he has been sued four times. Once, he says, the CEO of a small company got really really mad and sent some guys to sit outside his house in a black truck.</li></ol><p>That last one in particular was a problem for us. We're journalists. We can't take sides. We can't bet against a particular company. If there were a section on shorting in the NPR ethics guidelines I'm pretty sure it would say what Andrew Left said: \"Don't do it.\"</p><p>We came up with a solution that seemed fair, and fun. Instead of shorting one company, we could short every company. We could short the entire stock market. We could short America!</p><p>We ran the idea by another well-known short seller, Sahm Adrangi, who runs a hedge fund called Kerrisdale Capital.</p><p>\"That's a terrible idea,\" he said. \"It's a great way to lose lots of money.\"</p><p>The U.S. stock market has a long long history of going up over time. And a lot of U.S. companies these days are really global multinational companies. So, he explained, we'd be shorting not just America but the entire planet.</p><p>Adrangi did have a name for what we were proposing. He called it \"The Armageddon Trade.\"</p><p>Which kind of sealed it for me. I liked the ridiculousness of betting against America, and the entire planet.</p><p>Our previous two investments — in a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/124587240/planet-money-s-toxic-asset\">toxic asset</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/02/07/130597201/the-friday-podcast-gold\">gold coin</a> — both lost money. So why not?</p><p>I called a broker at E-Trade and told him we wanted to short the stock market. It was remarkably easy to do. We used $400 of our own, personal money; in the unlikely event we make a profit, we're going to give it to charity.</p><p>(Side note for finance nerds: We shorted SPY, the exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500. That's not the whole stock market, but it's close.)</p><p>America, your bad news is now our good news. We'll let you know how it goes.
