Just the natural changes that occur. We could be looking at a combination of that, combined with changes in the amount of waste water that is disposed of and natural stress changes. There are all sorts of different options that we are looking at and things that might be occurring.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hCJWDI8AAAAJ&hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Austin Holland</a></strong>, a research seismologist at the <a href=\"http://www.ogs.ou.edu/homepage.php\" target=\"_blank\">Oklahoma Geological Survey</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
