In many states, only doctors will be able to prescribe the medications, not nurses or physician assistants.</p><p>The move, announced in a federal notice, comes more than a decade after the Drug Enforcement Administration first recommended reclassifying hydrocodone due to its risks for abuse and addiction. For years, physician groups and the Food and Drug Administration opposed the move, saying it would burden health care providers and patients while driving up costs.</p><p>But last year the FDA changed its position, citing the national epidemic of overdoses and deaths tied to prescription painkillers known as opioids.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.silverhillhospital.org/About-Silver-Hill/Newsroom/Our-Experts/Collins.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Collins</a></strong>, M.D., physician-in-chief at Silver Hill Hospital in Connecticut.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
