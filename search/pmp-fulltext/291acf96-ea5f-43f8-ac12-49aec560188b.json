In the Shire river watershed, the hillsides have been completely deforested for cooking fuel, among other things, so there’s nothing to stop the huge amounts of rainfall from surging into the valleys.</p>\n<p>Climate change may also be involved. The intensity of the storm system behind the floods fits with what climate models have been projecting could happen as carbon emissions trap more energy in the atmosphere. These storms can have devastating effects on poor countries like Malawi, where many families live in simple mud brick homes and farm land that can’t withstand this kind of weather.</p>\n<p>Observers fear the story that will evolve here over the weeks and months will be that of a serious food shortage. Many farmers’ fields have been completely devastated, leaving little opportunity to replant before the end of the country’s short rainy season. And the floods come at the tail end of a severe drought that also took a toll on food production.</p>\n<p>The country’s government is hardly in a position to respond to the crisis. Foreign aid, which makes up about 40 percent of Malawi’s economy, was recently cut off in the wake of a corruption scandal. And this week, the parliament went on strike demanding higher salaries. So the government is barely operating.</p>\n<p>Instead NGOs are largely running the relief efforts, but they’re already running short on cash.</p>\n<p>With more rain in the forecast, the conditions that caused this widespread displacement are far from over.</p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"The flooding has been centered around the Shire River in southern Malawi.
