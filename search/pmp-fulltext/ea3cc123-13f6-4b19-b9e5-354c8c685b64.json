We're talking about women in many parts of the world who, at a young age, have the most sensitive parts of their sex organs removed — and their mothers and fathers allow it. In some cultures, it's a tradition.</p>\n<p>But a rapper from Burkina Faso, in West Africa, is trying to break the stigma of talking about FGM.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/smockey_abazon\">Smockey</a> is a rapper who lives in the capital city of Ouagadougou and he's trying to make strides in the fight against FGM with his latest song, \"Tomber la Lame,\" or \"Drop the Blade.\"</p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_no_border cta_align-right cta_icon-engagement cta_bg-gray\" data-entity-id=\"78331\" data-entity-title=\"Listen to Smockey's music\" data-entity-type=\"node\"><aside class=\"node node-story-act story-act-cta story-act-nid-78331 cta-type-external-link cta-style-learn view-mode-entity_embed\" data-tracking-code=\"listen-to-smockey-s-music\"><div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    Listen to Smockey's music  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-image\">\n    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/Smockey2.jpeg?itok=ulANYImC\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-teaser\">\n    You can learn more about Smockey's music and his campaign to end female genital mutilation in his home country of Burkina Faso  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-external-link\">\n    <a href=\"http://www.smockey.net/\">Check out his music here</a>  </div>\n<p>  </p></aside></div>\n<p>In the introduction to the song, Smockey is poetic and graphic:</p>\n<p><em>Each time her sex is butchered with the pretext of purity...</em></p>\n<p><em>...three million of our sisters face this violence each year...</em></p>\n<p>\"Some women told me that when they listen to that song, they start crying because it's a sad song,\" he says.</p>\n<p>His own family has plenty of experience in fighting FGM. \"My wife is also very [skeptical] about this practice,\" Smockey says.
