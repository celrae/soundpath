As she explained to host Ophira Eisenberg on the <em>Ask Me Another</em> stage, Coupe had to overcome one thing before she could play these roles: a New Hampshire accent.</p><p>\"It's not great,\" she said of her home state's dialect. \"It doesn't make you sound smart at all.\"</p><p>Coupe made a name for herself as a comedic actress with featured roles on <em>Scrubs</em>, <em>Flight of the Conchords</em>, and the cult classic sitcom <em>Happy Endings</em>. She currently stars on Benched as Nina, a corporate lawyer who, after a very public nervous breakdown, finds herself working as a public defender. The transition to lead role had Coupe nervous at first. \"There was a lot of throwing up in my mouth for a little bit when I found out,\" she joked.</p><p>Adjusting to the grueling production schedule was also a challenge. \"I would just keep looking like, 'oh, there's my name, and there's my name again, and that's it, and okay, so I'm in all day. And by all day I mean until the wee hours of the next day.\"</p><p>Of course, Eliza Coupe is all about <em>Happy Endings</em>. That's why we asked her to lend her comedic talents to a game that takes depressing, dark movies and reimagines them with sunnier, happier finales. Can you guess the movie based on its rewritten ending? <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/12/04/366564178/eliza-coupe-legal-eagle\">And later in the show, we test her legal prowess in a game all about courtroom jargon.</a>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
