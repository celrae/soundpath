But as an edict, to just say that the police department can't operate — my understanding is that he does not have the power to do that.</p><p>\"That being said,\" Knowles continues, \"I have been and continue to be open to having a dialogue and work together to find an agreeable solution for all of us. Unfortunately, there continues to be hostile language coming out of the Justice Department — or rather, from Eric Holder, specifically.\"</p><p>Asked to clarify that remark, Knowles says that when he has spoken with \"bureaucrats at the DOJ — and I mean bureaucrats in that they're lifelong, career DOJ officials — there is a great sense of optimism from them, and from us, about working together. At the same time, I turn on CNN and watch Eric Holder — that's not the same language the DOJ uses with us. So, I think that is frustrating, and concerning.\"</p><p>The shootings occurred during a protest spurred by the announcement that Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/03/11/392381084/ferguson-mo-police-chief-resigns-following-justice-department-report\">is resigning</a>. Many of the protesters have demanded that Knowles should also go.</p><p>Activist Montague Simmons of the Organization for Black Struggle tells NPR's Cheryl Corley, \"If the city is really going to experience what we've been fighting for, those folks who've been maintaining and protecting the institution have to get out of the way.\"</p><p>Responding to the call for a \"clean slate\" in Ferguson to help the community start over, Knowles says, \"Look, somebody here has to be left standing, to make sure that the government continues to operate.\"</p><p>Noting that he can be removed from his post by being either voted out of office, impeached, or recalled, Knowles says, \"I get, on a daily basis, an enormous amount of support from residents of all backgrounds, ages and races. So, I have not seen any reason why I should step down.\"</p><p>He adds:</p><blockquote><p>\"I have been committed for the last six months — well, seven months — to making sure that this community hangs together, and bringing this community together. And I'm going to continue to do that. If the people decide that I'm not the person to do that, that's fine.</p><p>\"You know, I'm a part-time mayor who has taken a sabbatical from my full-time job that I pay my bills and support my family with, to make sure that this community can come together... and to save this community. I've given every last measure at this point, and I will continue to do so, as long as the citizens will have me.\"</p></blockquote>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
