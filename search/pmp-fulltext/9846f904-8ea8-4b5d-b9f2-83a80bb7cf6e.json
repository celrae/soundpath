The researchers asked a range of questions about the women's cooking habits. And they documented the women's weight and height to calculate their BMIs.</p><p>\"In terms of weight, those who watched cooking shows and cooked frequently from scratch had a mean weight of 164 lbs,\" according to the paper. By comparison, women who watched the shows but didn't cook much from scratch weighed, on average, about 153 pounds.</p><p>That's an 11-pound difference between the \"doers\" (the women watching and cooking) compared with the \"viewers\" (the women who watched but didn't cook).</p><p>\"Being a doer,\" Pope says, \"may put you at risk for packing on extra pounds.\"</p><p>This is not the first study to suggest that home cooking can potentially be bad for our waistlines — and perhaps our health.</p><p>As we've <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2015/01/09/376098496/is-cook-at-home-always-good-health-advice\">reported</a>, a study published in the journal <em>Preventive Medicine</em> found that the more time middle-aged women spent cooking at home, the more likely they were to develop symptoms of metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk of heart disease and diabetes.</p><p>And these findings challenge the going belief — put forth by advocates such at <a href=\"http://michaelpollan.com/\">Michael Pollan</a> — that home cooking, compared to eating out or buying prepared foods, is best.</p><p>But Pope says she doesn't want to turn people off to cooking: \"As a dietitian, I want to encourage everyone to [cook at home] as often as possible.\"</p><p>But she says you've got to be mindful of how and what you cook. And you may not find inspiration for healthy cooking by watching TV cooking shows.</p><p>\"If you're just watching <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/the-pioneer-woman.html\">Pioneer Woman</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/giada-at-home.html\">Giada at Home</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.barefootcontessa.com/\">Barefoot Contessa</a> — which are great shows that I sometimes watch to relax — they're not necessarily portraying healthy recipes,\" Pope says.</p><p>Take, for instance, de Laurentiis' chocolate hazelnut pie, which is loaded with butter.</p><p>\"Butter in your kitchen is still butter,\" Pope says. \"And it has the same calories as if you ate it in a restaurant meal.\"</p><p>And, please, we're not trying to pick on de Laurentiis. She's been asked about her rich recipes and her own eating habits. In one i<a href=\"http://pagesix.com/2014/11/20/skinny-giada-spits-out-everything-she-cooks/\">nterview</a>, she said it's the No. 1 question from fans of her show.</p><p>\"And the answer is,\" de Laurentiis is quoted as saying, \"I eat a little bit of everything and not a lot of anything. Everything in moderation.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
