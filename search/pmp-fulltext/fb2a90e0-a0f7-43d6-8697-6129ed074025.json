These are the moments when everything seems to click, and people leap forward into their careers</em><em>.</em></p><p>Susan Stamberg is a big name in public radio. One of NPR's \"founding mothers,\" she was the first woman to anchor a national nightly news program when she co-hosted NPR's <em>All Things Considered </em>for 14 years. Listeners hear her reports as a special correspondent, and every year at Thanksgiving, her mother's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/4175681/susan-stamberg-s-cranberry-relish-tradition\">cranberry relish recipe</a> returns to the air.</p><p>But Stamberg's career began its ascent with a nervous mistake.</p><p>\"My big break occurred essentially at the moment I made my radio debut,\" she says.</p><p>Stamberg was working at a local station in Washington, D.C., producing a daily program when the weather girl called in sick. Stamberg says the format called for a weather forecast.</p><p>\"There was nobody else to do it,\" she says. \"It was up to me.\"</p><p>Back in those days, Stamberg says, you would dial WE 6-1212 on a phone to get the weather report. She was supposed to write down the forecast and bring her notes into the studio for her live report.</p><p>\"But I was so nervous I forgot to call,\" Stamberg says. \"So I go into the studio, the on-air light comes on, and I think, 'I don't know what the weather is because I didn't make the phone call.' \"</p><p>She thought she could just look out the window — but the only window in the studio was out of reach and covered with curtains.</p><p>She was in the dark.</p><p>\"So I did the only thing I could think of to do,\" Stamberg says. \"I made it up.\"</p><p>She says it was in the middle of February, but she was so nervous, she said the temperature was in the 90s.</p><p>\"And that the barometer was — I didn't even know what that meant,\" she says. \"And then the format called for me to repeat what the weather was. And I couldn't remember what I had said because I was so nervous.\"</p><p>So Stamberg made it up again.</p><p>\"Now I say it's 62 degrees and the wind and the velocity is 109 and I went on and on and on,\" Stamberg says. \"Mercifully, got off the air and happily our three listeners did not call. So nobody noticed that, anyway.\"</p><p>But Stamberg says her not-so-glamorous on-air debut taught her a couple things about being on the radio: Never go on the air unprepared and never lie to your listeners.</p><p>\"I think I was so petrified and so relieved when I was finished,\" she says. \"But yeah, something in the back of my head said, 'You know, this could be fun.' So this was the beginning of my inauspicious broadcasting career.\"</p><p><em><em>We want to hear about </em>your<em> big break.
