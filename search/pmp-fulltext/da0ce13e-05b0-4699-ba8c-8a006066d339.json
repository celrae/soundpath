His songs are populated with high school burnouts, bitter, broken lovers, people living on the fringe who can't escape their own ghosts.</p><p>The songwriter's latest project is a novel, <em>Wolf in White Van</em>, and it's centered on another social outsider, whose sheltered, solitary life is disrupted when a disaster strikes. In a conversation with NPR's Lynn Neary about writing the book, Darnielle nails a fundamental difference between his two art forms.</p><p>\"It's sort of like comparing making a fire and building a house,\" he says. \"A song is fire.

It really does run through you like wind. Whereas a book is a journey: It's a thing you agree to go on with somebody, and I think every reader's experience of a book is going to be different. There are scenes in the book that feel very song-like to me, but I do think it's a different sort of ride. It's more of a marathon. My songs tend to sprint toward some epiphany and then explode.\"</p><p>Hear more of the conversation at the audio link.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
