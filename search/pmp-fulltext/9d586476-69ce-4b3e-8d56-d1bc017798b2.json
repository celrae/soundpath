We generally never discuss the specifics of a student-athlete&#8217;s medical care, but Shane Morris was removed from yesterday’s game against Minnesota after further aggravating an injury to his leg that he sustained earlier in the contest. He was evaluated by our experienced athletic trainers and team physicians, and we&#8217;re confident proper medical decisions were made. The University of Michigan has a distinguished group of Certified Athletic Trainers and team physicians who are responsible for determining whether or not a player is physically able to play. Our coaches have no influence or authority to make determinations if or when an injured player returns to competition. The health and welfare of our student-athletes is and will continue to be a top priority.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Author<strong> John Bacon, </strong>who covers college football, tells <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now</a>&#8216;s </em>Robin Young<em> </em>that the referees and coaches failed Morris, and it did not appear that doctors even were able to test him for concussions.</p><p>&#8220;It is not up to a 19 year-old quarterback who has already got his head banged by someone else&#8217;s helmet to determine his own health,&#8221; Bacon said. &#8220;We still do not know, 48 hours later, what really happened.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.johnubacon.com/\"><strong>John Bacon</strong></a>, author of “<a style=\"color: #2c95c7\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Long-Fight-College-Football/dp/1476706433/?tag=wburorg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Fourth And Long: The Fight For The Soul Of College Football</a>.” He tweets <a style=\"color: #2c95c7\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Johnubacon\" target=\"_blank\">@Johnubacon</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 WBUR-FM.
