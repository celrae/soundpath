What do you do when you want to be a giver, but just don't have time to do all of the giving that you feel you'd like to do?</p>\n<p>\"First thing I would say is you want to ask: Where can I have the most distinctive impact? Can I make a distinctive contribution here? Or if not, then I'll connect this person to somebody else who's equally or better suited to help,\" says Grant. \"I think a second one is to think about, OK, every time that you help somebody else, you're potentially making an investment and encouraging them to be helpful as well. So I would want to make that investment with people that you think can bring maybe the greatest return -- not necessarily back to you, but who might pay it forward the most.\"</p>\n<p>One piece of advice that Grant wants to leave with listeners: Successful givers are quite comfortable asking for help.
