Yes, he means <em>those</em> Vanderbilts. <a href=\"http://www.fisherislandclub.com/History\">They owned the island in through 1930s</a> after purchasing it from the eponymous Carl Fisher in 1927.\n<p>And like the Vanderbilts, Bluntzer says, most of the people who own condos on Fisher Island don’t live there full time. “For a lot of people, this may be their third or fourth or fifth home.” The island has on average about a thousand people living on it at a time.

They had ready cash and knew a good deal when they saw one.

If you’re not cleared with security by one of the owners or club members, you’re not allowed on the island,” Bluntzer says. “Safety, security and privacy. A lot of these folks, they’re not necessarily celebrities, but they’re very successful.
