Now a “reform conservative” movement within the GOP is looking to win them back.  This hour On Point:  A new Republican playbook for America’s middle class.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: right\"><strong>&#8211; Tom Ashbrook</strong></p><h4>Guests</h4><p><a title=\"Yuval Levin\" href=\"http://eppc.org/fellows-scholars/yuval-levin/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Yuval Levin</strong></a>, fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

The recipients in the current system may not get good care or students may be weighed down with huge debt and no useful degree, but liberals are content so long as more and more taxpayer money is poured into failing programs. &#8221;</p><p><a title=\"WSJ Reform\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303903304579587824109102770\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Wall Street Journal</strong>: A Cautious Step Toward Republican Reform</a> - &#8220;By acknowledging and cataloging the challenges facing the middle class, policy analyst Peter Wehner takes a large step toward reality in the &#8216;Room to Grow&#8217; introductory chapter. Mr. Wehner underscores the average American&#8217;s discontent with the present and anxiety about the future. He traces the pessimism to long-established trends in the U.S. economy, including stagnant wages and economic mobility below the levels of many European countries.&#8221;</p><h4><a title=\"Room To Grow\" href=\"http://ygnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Room-To-Grow.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Read &#8220;Room To Grow: Conservative Reform For Limited Government and a Thriving Middle Class&#8221;</a></h4>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
