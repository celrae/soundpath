Jonathan Singer</h4><p><strong>On current regulations on marijuana edibles</strong></p><p>“In Colorado we have a very robust regulatory system that really encourages parental responsibility and really what this task force is dealing with is what the candy or baked goods look like outside of the package. Right now, every edible marijuana item needs to leave a marijuana dispensary in a child-proof, opaque container. Basically a resealable a locking zip-lock bag, not just a bag anyone can open easily.”</p><p><strong>On making marijuana edibles more identifiable</strong></p><p>“I’d like to see those individual products stamped, shaped or marked in some way that makes it easily identifiable for the average consumer, whether you&#8217;re 6 years old or 60 years old, to make sure that people know what they’re putting in their bodies”</p><p><strong>On what Colorado state legislators are doing</strong></p><p>“What we’re doing now at the state is requiring by October 30, every marijuana piece sold be sold in single serving sizes of ten milligrams, and so someone like a Maureen Dowd or any tourist isn’t going to be ingesting 30, 50 or 100 milligrams in one serving. The other thing is the industry is actually stepping up with their own public education campaign saying ‘start low, go slow’. It might take an hour or two or even two and half hours to feel the intoxicating effects of marijuana.”</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2013A/directory.nsf/MemberDetailPage?OpenForm&district=11&chamber=house\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jonathan Singer</strong></a>, Colorado state representative.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
