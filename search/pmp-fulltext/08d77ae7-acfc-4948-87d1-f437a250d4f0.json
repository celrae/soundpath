Why are we at war?</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Well, I think the real trouble is going to be trying to find a mate when you go to their house and you have no conversation piece because you’re just staring at a silver box.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> There is absolutely nothing!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> “You too use the cloud.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> “I like every piece of music in the world as well. I see you do!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> We have that in common. Alright, well, there you go. Dara, somewhere in there lies an answer.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> The truth and great wisdom, yeah.</p>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<h2>No excuses for sporty butt-swats</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Alright, here’s something from Chris in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and this kind of goes to one of your first books, “Fever Pitch,” which is about your sports obsession. “Is it okay to pat someone on the rear end, as in good job, during a casual pick-up basketball game?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> Being English, we haven’t touched anyone…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> In decades.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> Since the Queen knighted Sir Francis Drake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Hands off.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> There you go. So, I think there’s your answer, Chris. It’s <em>not</em> okay.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> It’s <em>never</em> okay. It’s never okay to shake their hand or anything.</p>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<h2>Books and movies can do different things differently</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Alright. So, this next question comes from Tim in Lexington, Massachusetts. Tim writes: “I am so sick of people telling me when I express a positive view about a movie that, ‘The book was better.’ I’m willing to accept that the book was good. In fact, I <em>love</em> books! But books and movies do different things. How do I politely convey this sentiment, you know, without coming across like a jerk?”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> Well, the first thing to say is there are a lot more people that see movies than read books, so I’m very impressed that all your friends are so down on movie adaptations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Well done, Tim.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> I mean, obviously, I’ve had some experience of this. It doesn’t matter what book it is and what the movie is like, people will always say, “My favorite scene was missing.” That is <em>the rule</em> of movie adaptation.</p>\n<br />\n<p>I mean, movies are something different. That’s all you can say. In terms of screen time, a movie is, very crudely, a quarter of the length of a book, so three-quarters of it is missing. Sometimes movies can give greater emotional punch than a book, but they can never be quite as sophisticated. There’s just nothing you can do about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Do you think, as an author, now that you’ve adapted a couple books, do you approach it differently maybe than someone who hasn’t written a novel?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> The only way I approach it differently is I always make sure that the writer is in the loop. Sometimes books can disappear, literally, for years. You know, there can be two or three years in that process where you simply don’t know what’s going on or what’s happened to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> And was there actually a moment where you wanted to do something to the script and Cheryl was dead set against it?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> No, never ever. And I said to her at the beginning, “You will find parts of this difficult,” especially as it’s a memoir and it’s a very, very personal memoir. Effectively, she has to watch her own mother die on screen, and it’s a very difficult experience, but she was never phased for a moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Really? It seems like, because when you’re cutting a scene out of her book, you’re cutting a scene out of her life.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> Yes, yes. You’re reducing her life by about 15 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> I mean, she had nothing to say?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> She always understood that the movie had to be an hour and three-quarters long, and the book was 400 pages long.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I have a question, Nick, not for spoilers, but do you still have the character walking down the Pacific Crest Trail? Because that was my favorite part of the book.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Or she’s now on Mars?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> No, it’s all about the backstory. There’s no trail anymore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Darnit, I think you missed an opportunity.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> No, you see, this is where you’re naive. Do you want to go and see “Wild II”? I think you do! That’s why I’m a producer on this movie.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> This is why you get the producer credits.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> Exactly, exactly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Oh, man.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I’m learning here.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Thank you so much for telling our audience how to behave.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Nick Hornby:</strong> Well, it was a lot of fun. Thank you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br /></div>","published":"2014-12-05T06:49:57+00:00","teaser":"Writer Nick Hornby is the author of best-selling novels including “High Fidelity” and “About a Boy,” both of which were turned into hit movies.
