His latest (and fourteenth) solo album, <em>Avonmore</em>, comes out Nov. 18.</p><p>He recently sat down to chat about the record and his life of music with <em>All Songs Considered</em> hosts Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton. Speaking from member station <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WNYC</a> in New York, Ferry talked about his love for sad music, why he'd like to see his songs turned into a Broadway musical and how he was inspired to become a musician after hitchhiking to London to see Otis Redding play.</p><p>You can listen to the full interview with the link above, or read select quotes and hear songs from the new album below.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
