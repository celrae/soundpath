The group's singer and songwriter got his start playing basement bars in Portland, Ore., and as he tells NPR's David Greene, sometimes even the bartender would leave the room.</p><p>\"I didn't really care what people thought because nobody was thinking about it. There was no audience to not care about, and I think it led me to a lot of experimentation,\" he says. \"Not ever taking yourself so seriously seemed to me a really important part about good music.\"</p><p>That might be why the latest Decemberists record has taken a little longer than usual. Meloy spoke with Greene about taking time to be a father, explore new sides of his relationships and write — without pressure or expectation — before getting started on the new album <em>What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World</em>.
