Slowly, one after another, motorcycles pull into the lot. By the time the sun rises, more than 100 bikers have arrived, including 20-year-old Vandit Hura. He’s a law student from Noida, a satellite city of Delhi. He rides a Royal Enfield, known for its unique sound. “When I was young, I used to run outside my house and listen to that sound: 'dug dug dug dug dug,'” he says, impersonating the chug of a single-cylinder Enfield motor.</p>\n<p>You may not have heard of the Royal Enfield brand, but it’s a classic — one of the first motorcycle companies in the world. Founded in the United Kingdom at the turn of the century, Royal Enfield is now an Indian company. And these days, Royal Enfield outsells Harley Davidson around the world. The success of the company is due largely to sales in India, and it's one sign of the growing economy here.</p>\n<p>Another sign of India’s rising economy is the growth of motorcycle clubs like this one. The leader of today’s ride, Mohit Ahuja, gathers everyone for a short speech. He welcomes the crowd and explains the route they will be taking. He’s tall, with a dark beard, a red-and-black bikers' jacket and camouflage pants. “Good morning,” he says. The crowd yells back enthusiastically, \"'Good morning!\" The rain hasn’t dampened anyone's excitement.</p>\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"286831\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_description[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_description[und][0][format]\":\"full_html\",\"field_byline_text[und][0][value]\":\"David Weinberg/Marketplace\",\"field_migration_notes[und][0][value]\":\"\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":490,\"width\":490,\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]</p>\n<p>“Let’s have some brotherhood happening today and let’s hope the gods have mercy on us and stop the rains,” he yells. “Lets get geared up, guys.

They also drive by slums flooded by muddy water, and piles of trash being picked at by wild pigs.</p>\n<p>The ride ends with a party in the rural outskirts of town where men play drums in a field and rev their motorcycles to the beat.</p>\n<p>While these partying bikers are one example of India’s growing middle class, the fact is a huge portion of the population has been left out of the country’s economic rise. India is home to one-third of the world’s poor.</p>\n<p>Historically, the key to pulling millions of people out of poverty has been industrialization — the kind of factory jobs that turned China into the world’s second-biggest economy. The success of Royal Enfield is one example of successful Indian manufacturing, but manufacturing only makes up 16 percent of the country’s economy.</p>\n<p>In India, as in much of the developing world, there has been a migration of people from rural villages to the city. Only 68 percent of rural Indians can read. So when they arrive in cities, few are qualified for the jobs that are available.</p>\n<p>Many of them end up as street vendors. These low-level entrepreneurs make up a big portion of the informal economy, which accounts for a staggering 92 percent of India’s population.</p>\n<p>Take the neighborhood called Mayur Vihar in East Delhi. Vendors offer kids' backpacks, pots and pans, clothing, toys, fabric and lots of street food.</p>\n<p>Lalchand Kashyap is a vendor. He sells a kind of street food, called Chaat. Every night he sets up his equipment in the same spot he’s had for the past 23 years. He has a couple of tables and a big metal cooking surface shaped like large satellite dish. In the center, potatoes are frying in a shallow pool of ghee, clarified butter oil that glistens under the battery-powered LED light he uses to cook by.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>One of his most popular dishes is aloo tikki, fried mashed potato patties smothered in masala, tamarind and coriander chutney, garnished with shredded cabbage, beets, radish, ginger and carrots and finished with a squeeze of lemon. Kashyap charges 40 rupees, about $0.37. It’s a dish that takes a lot of work to make.</p>\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"286838\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_description[und][0][value]\":\"\",\"field_description[und][0][format]\":\"full_html\",\"field_byline_text[und][0][value]\":\"David Weinberg/Marketplace\",\"field_migration_notes[und][0][value]\":\"\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":550,\"width\":800,\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]</p>\n<p>Kashyup starts his day at 8:00 a.m. doing prep work at home with his family, boiling potatoes making chutney, chopping vegetables.

There are 888 affiliates with 553,000 dues-paying members across India. They lobby for legislation, offer free legal services and training to improve hygiene and they help vendors access financial services.</p>\n<p>If efforts like this succeed in bringing the huge numbers of informal workers into the middle class, economist Jayshree Sengupta believes they could be an internal economic engine that drives India’s growth.</p>\n<p>“I think China's going that way because China has realized that the export-led growth has led to pollution where people are suffocating,” Sengupta says. “We're also experiencing that in Delhi. There's no point depending on the export growth. We have a huge market of 1.2 billion people, so get money in their pockets so they can buy our own things.”</p>\n<p>Much of the focus of NASVI’s work is to prevent income drain from extortion. But actually raising the income of street vendors is a more difficult task. One way they do that is by organizing street food festivals to improve the image of street vendors, make them more appealing to locals and tourists.</p>\n<p>Kashyup worked one of those festivals.
