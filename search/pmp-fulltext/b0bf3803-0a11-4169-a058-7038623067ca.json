But on <em>Captain of None</em>, she's added lyrics for the first time.</p><p>\"I thought, 'OK, I'm going to try to learn singing,' but for about two years I sang completely the wrong way, which means I wasn't breathing properly,\" she says.</p><p>There is a running thread through all of her lyrics about the experience of being human: \"I think I was ready to write lyrics about trying to understand yourself, understand others and just realizing that you know — you never know what's in your heart.\"</p><p>Hear more at the audio link about Schott's transformation from instrumentalist to lyricist, and her thoughts on <em>Captain of None,</em> in an interview with NPR's Scott Simon.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
