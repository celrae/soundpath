Suddenly he was an observer to the world of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/100863084/the-velvet-underground\" target=\"_blank\">The Velvet Underground</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/tags/126933161/andy-warhol\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Warhol</a> and their coterie.</p><p>On his new album, <em>Standing In The Breach</em>, Browne revisits a song he wrote during this time: \"The Birds Of St. Marks,\" a portrait of Nico that he composed as he was leaving New York.</p><p>\"She was a big fan of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15786738/the-byrds\" target=\"_blank\">The Byrds</a>,\" Browne tells NPR's Melissa Block. \"She would say 'can you play something like <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/16269974/roger-mcguinn\" target=\"_blank\">Jim McGuinn</a>?' I'd go, 'well, no.' \"</p><p>That request was in his mind when he returned to \"The Birds Of St. Marks.\"</p><p>\"I guess I thought the song wasn't really finished,\" Browne says. \"But when I dusted it off, it seemed fine. It seemed — matter of fact, there was something about it being something from a long time ago that gave it a quality that I liked. It was, you know, like a picture from [an] earlier time of my life. But I'd never done it the way I intended it to be when I wrote it, so I realized I could do it like The Byrds.\"</p><p>Browne changed the arrangement to evoke The Byrds' sound, featuring a 12-string guitar and adding high harmony. But he says that, though he might write them differently now, he left the words preserved.</p><p>\"C'mon. 'Dying midnight roses'? That's so extreme,\" Browne says. \"But that's what I began to like about it. It's just like — it's a young song. It really is from my 18-year-old eyes, looking wide-eyed at this Andy Warhol scene in New York.\"</p><p>In spite of the intervening years, Browne says it's not difficult to summon up that teenage version of himself.</p><p>\"There's something about playing a song 20, 40 years after you wrote it that is kind of exhilarating,\" Browne says. \"Because it's really like just opening a book in the middle, looking back at a time that was captured then, and actually may mean something different each time you revisit it.\"</p><p>Hear the rest of Jackson Browne's conversation with NPR's Melissa Block at the audio link.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
