But these days, she's got her own new album and tour, leading a small band of gifted musicians. Sofia's songs are about matters of the heart — and, as you'll hear in her performance here, it's hard to believe that feeling bad can sound this good. Her music doesn't wallow; instead, it makes me want to celebrate and experience the joy and pain along with her.</p><p>I hope you find a place in Raquel Sofia's music for yourself. Her voice, her songwriting and her performances more than met the expectations I had after hearing her EPs, so I don't doubt that you'll become a fan, too.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"No Me Importas\"</li><li>\"Agridulce\"</li><li>\"Te Amo Idiota\"</li><li>\"Hombre Como Tú\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Felix Contreras, Maggie Starbard; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Colin Marshall, Maggie Starbard; Production Assistant: Susan Hale Thomas; photo by Colin Marshall/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
