We've received more questions about the best ways to help than we can respond to. So we've created a space on Facebook for ongoing conversation. We'll do our best to get knowledgable people to answer your questions there.  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-external-link\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/370994693091970/\">Join: Helping Nepal</a>  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>“I met one woman, named Himali, who’s 23,” says Adams. “She was a bus driver — is a bus driver — in Jumla district, which is quite far away. She had both of her arms and legs broken by a wall that had fallen on the bus. And she then took a bus, I think six hours, to get to Kathmandu, with these broken limbs. I think they were splinted at the time. But these people are tough. It’s just amazing when you talk to them how resilient they are, and with what grace they’ve endured this.”</p>\n<p>Nepal's people are also dealing the loss of much of their heritage, as well. Many magnificent temples have been severely damaged or destroyed. In addition to the architectural and spiritual loss, the damage might spell the end of many jobs that depend on the tourist trade.</p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-04-28%2Fimages-nepal-show-people-are-hurting&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/story/images/mother_feature.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://admin.pri.org/file/motherfeaturejpg"},{"href":"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/04282015_01.mp3"},{"href":"http://admin.pri.org/file/0428201501mp3"}]}
