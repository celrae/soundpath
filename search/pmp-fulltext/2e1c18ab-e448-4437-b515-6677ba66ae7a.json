But Raila Odinga, who lost in 2007 and 2013, said the outcome of Nigeria’s election gives him hope. Buhari, who is 72 years old, lost elections three times before his successful campaign. Odinga will be the same age when Kenya holds its sixth presidential elections in 2017. Yesterday, he was quick to congratulate Buhari and note the importance of his victory to democracy across the continent:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\"><p>Jointly, with President-Elect Mr. Buhari, they have made a tremendous contribution to the democratisation journey in Africa.</p>\n<p>— Raila Odinga (@RailaOdinga) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RailaOdinga/status/582999465612550145\">March 31, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\"><p>I take this opportunity to congratulate Gen Buhari and the Nigerian people; this day dispels the numerous myths about elections in Africa.</p>\n<p>— Raila Odinga (@RailaOdinga) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RailaOdinga/status/582998900006498304\">March 31, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>In Tanzania, a young presidential hopeful, January Makamba, hopes to unseat his country's ruling party candidate in October. The incumbent president, Jakaya Kikwete, is ineligible to run for a third term. In the lead up to a hotly contested race, and in a climate of escalating sectarian <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/03/29/tanzania-politics-idINL6N0WV0IM20150329\">tensions</a> between Christian and Muslim communities in Tanzania, Makamba commended the importance of a ruling party concession.  </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\"><p>Calling to concede is a rarity in Africa.

Simple, says Nigerian writer and art historian Teju Cole. \"The incumbent was a failure. Goodluck Jonathan had really failed to satisfy the people's needs, to deal with corruption, to deal with terrorism, to actually provide any kind of inspiring leadership for the country,'' Cole says. Nigerians \"really wanted to be part of the modern world where such things can happen in an orderly way.''</p>\n<p>Incompetence and corruption exist well beyond Nigeria's borders, but will others get a chance to throw their leaders out?</p>\n<p>There is no shortage of African presidential elections over the coming months. Elections will select heads of state in Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Togo, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Burundi, Chad, Niger, Central African Republic, Guinea and Tanzania.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"465\" width=\"473\" alt=\"pic pres\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/africapresgraf.jpg?itok=EKH2Rl11\" title=\"\" /><span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>David Conrad</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Current sitting presidents facing elections include: Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi, Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, Faure Gnassingbe of Togo, and Alassane Ouattara of Ivory Coast.</p>\n<p>The outlook for an opposition victory over a sitting leader is unlikely, however.</p>\n<p>In Togo and Burundi opposition groups unsuccessfully protested the decision of incumbents to run for a third term; the sitting president is expected to win easily in both countries. A similar outcome appears to be taking shape this month in Sudan. </p>\n<p>Despite protests and calls to postpone the election by opposition parties, Sudanese citizens are scheduled to head to the polls on April 13.
