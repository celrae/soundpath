This week on <em>All Songs Considered</em>, we bring you a new track from upcoming album <em>Untethered Moon,</em> which you can <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/04/12/398340526/first-listen-built-to-spill-untethered-moon\">hear in its entirety</a> on First Listen.</p><p>Also on the show, we'll hear from Algiers, the new act that host Bob Boilen is most excited about, whose striking, eerie, gospel sound is inspired by their Atlanta origins. Plus, the young, nostalgic folk duo, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/149944834/the-milk-carton-kids\">The Milk Carton Kids</a> have a new album, called <em>Monterey</em><em>. </em>A new album from the Rhode Island husband-wife duo <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/300235216/brown-bird\">Brown Bird</a> was completed after the death of singer David Lamb. It's a bold and beautiful collection of songs written and recorded in the year leading up to his death from leukemia, and finished by Lamb's wife and bandmate, MorganEve Swain. Detroit rock band Protomartyr teams up with The Breeders vocalist Kelly Deal to create an edgy single. We'll also hear Sick Sad World, the new project from Seattle skateboarder and kickboxer Jake Jones, and a cut from songwriter Holly Miranda's upcoming solo album.</p><p>But first, it's Bob's birthday week and Robin's got a special gift.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
