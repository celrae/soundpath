That amounts to about $1.90 per phone user per year. The fund was established in 1997 to ensure phone access to all Americans, and was extended to include Internet connection.</p><p>The FCC says that the fund was not set up with an annual adjustment and the increase will make a much-needed additional $1.5 billion available per year.</p><p>The two Republicans on the FCC board have indicated opposition to the plan, but it is expected to be approved in December with votes from the three Democrats who make up a majority of the board.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://recode.net/author/amy-schatz/\" target=\"_blank\">Amy Schatz</a></strong>, senior editor for policy at the tech news site Re/code.
