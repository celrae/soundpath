What Sierra Leone and Liberia urgently need are more beds in case management centers, and they need them now.\"</p><p>Gaojia says the Emergency Operations Center estimates the country will see a \"surge of about 15 to 20 percent of the cases that we have had ... anywhere between 200 or more nationwide.\"</p><p>But even with <a href=\"https://ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/press-releases/africa/sierra-leone/sierra-leone-red-cross-opens-ebola-treatment-centre-to-help-meet-escalating-needs/\">a new</a> Red Cross facility in Kenema, the country's third largest city, there aren't enough beds at treatment centers. Instead, there are holding centers, which many people view as places where suspected Ebola patients go to die alone.</p><p>\"These holding centers are very bare bones,\" says Kelto. \"They don't have IVs, they don't have saline solution to keep people hydrated, they don't have medicine to treat diarrhea or to stop vomiting. So essentially it's no different than just lying at home in your own bed.\"</p><p>In the meantime, the prospect of a lockdown has caused a spike in food prices in Freetown. \"Everything is so expensive, double the price,\" says Miriam Kallom, a shopper in Freetown. That's a problem in one of the world's <a href=\"http://www.sl.undp.org/content/sierraleone/en/home/countryinfo/\">poorest countries</a>, where many live on day-to-day wages.</p><p>The health ministry plans to send over 7,000 teams of four people each to go door-to-door throughout Sierra Leone \"to disseminate information on Ebola virus and enlist family and community support to participate in the response process.\" Gaojia says. Each team will include a healthcare worker, community volunteer \"and possibly a youth within the community.\"</p><p>Gaojia says that they will be \"using an encouragement approach,\" telling people who may be ill or who have ill family members to call a hotline so a rapid response team can transport them to a holding center, where they can be tested for Ebola.</p><p>\"Military people, police and soldiers are not the face of this campaign at all,\" says Gaojia. \"Of course, the police and military will be in readiness in the event of any lawlessness.\"</p><p>The volunteer teams are set to work between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. In the evening, people will be able to move three to four doors from their homes. Vehicular movement will still be restricted.</p><p>\"We don't expect [Sierra Leoneans] to refuse,\" Sidie Yahya Tunis, communications director for the health ministry of Sierra Leone, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29093048\">told the</a> BBC earlier this month. \"You follow or else you'll be breaking the law. If you disobey then you are disobeying the president.\"</p><p>Initially, the plan was for the volunteer teams to reach every single house in the country of 6 million. Now, their aim is to visit 1.5 million households, each of which will get a bar of soap.</p><p>The only protective equipment the volunteers will carry, Gaojia says, is rain gear.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
