Cut open a bag, throw it out like feed for people.</p>\n<br />\n<p>I think the key thing is make sure people who are really close friends aren’t next to each other, because you do want to try to open up the room a bit.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> You definitely want to think about who’s gonna get along well with each other, who’s gonna bring out conversation in each other. You’re not gonna want to put, you know, the Yankees and the Red Sox fan right next to each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> So you wouldn’t have say John Boehner sitting next to Barack Obama?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Daniel Post-Senning:</strong> The danger of an eye roll is imminent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> It could bring down out entire global economy.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> They could always chat over cigarettes outside.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s true.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> All right, well Jackie, it sounds like you can do whatever you want basically.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> Pretty much!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> I mean, isn’t that true in the modern world? I mean, do we really have to ascribe to this?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Daniel Post-Senning:</strong>&nbsp;I like Lizzie’s answer. Mix them up. Take people out of their comfort zone to generate a little interest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> All right, there you go Jackie.</p>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Sealing Out the Smoking Section</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Okay, here’s Robbie in West Los Angeles. Robbie writes, “I’ve been living in this tiny ramshackle apartment with a courtyard and I really like it. I only have a few neighbors, but many of them smoke, and their favorite place is at the communal picnic table right outside by unit. The smoke gathers and comes in through my heating duct- not pleasant in my living room, but it’s obvious that it’s the nicest place for them to light up. Should I say something? It’s gonna be a major buzzkill for them, literally, and I can probably live with it.”\"</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> This is a great question.&nbsp;I have a similar question here in New York. My neighbors smoke and it drives me crazy.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Daniel Post-Senning:</strong> They’re wrestling with it in Burlington, where they’re banning smoking on the public streets.</p>\n<br />\n<p>I definitely like the awareness that smokers are bringing to thinking about the environments that they’re in. This living situation, it might be tough to break up that kind of a social clique, particularly if they’re already stepping outside.</p>\n<br />\n<p>I would get specific here and look at maybe that vent. Maybe there’s something you can do to the vent. Maybe there’s a way to just close it&nbsp;when the session’s going on or whatever it is.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> I’m with Dan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s interesting. It’s rare that we hear actually etiquette in favor of the <em>smokers</em> anymore.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> The smokers need a place to go. It is important to recognize that they have every right to smoke and they are doing the right thing by smoking outdoors. So I think the best thing he can do is talk to his super about if there anything he can do to close that vent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> But there’s science now that says secondhand smoke is equally as damaging to the lungs as firsthand smoke.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> Oh that’s right, I forgot, you’re trying to find reasoning for <em>your</em> neighbors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Well, I’m just saying, years ago I think if this was a question about a restaurant we would say smokers needed a place in the restaurant to smoke. And now we almost universally don’t think that’s the case. So when is the tipping point?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Daniel Post-Senning:</strong>&nbsp;When you can’t close the vent and it starts to really be a problem. You can’t go to sleep at night, maybe you escalate. That’s the time to get the person with the authority or the standing to address the situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> What about being passive-aggressive? What about destroying the table, stuff like that?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> Oh yeah, we haven’t had a passive-aggressive answer in a while.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I would cook something that smelled awful and blow it on them with a fan.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Daniel Post-Senning:</strong> Just pull the picnic table 10 feet away.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> Here’s our passive-aggressive answer: you leave a note on the picnic table that says “I’m so happy that you can enjoy conversation and your cigarettes outside, because it does help the building so much, but I do wish that you could blow the smoke out of my general direction as I don’t enjoy it in my living room.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Do you think it’ll work?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> No. Not at all.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Daniel Post-Senning:</strong> No.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Not with smokers. They’ll smoke more.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Daniel Post-Senning:</strong> It sounds like the smoke gathers and travels in the vent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Yeah, it’s not gonna be easy unless they have a fan.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> Yeah, and the other thing – and I hate to have to say this but – you do <em>choose</em> to live there, and at some point you can choose to leave.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Oh man.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> And Robbie, you choose to live in LA where people can sit outside a lot of the time, so why don’t you move somewhere colder.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s true. And as they often say, living in LA, breathing the air, you’re smoking cigarettes basically.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> Poor Robbie though. I feel like we did not give him a real answer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I think we kind of showed how complicated it is. It sounds like people need a space to smoke outside, they live there too, but if it really starts to get really bad, then after talking to the super, you might have to leave.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Daniel Post-Senning:</strong> Look who’s getting good at the etiquette advice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Yeah, Brendan.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> A-student.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> We should just have Brendan answer that one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> You know why? You know how I got better? <em>Miss Manners.</em>&nbsp;I have to tell you.&nbsp;She just really made everything so clear.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> By the way, Sam has a look of shock on his face with that. His eyebrows just hit the ceiling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Sam, one of our studio engineers, cannot believe his ears.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> Yes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Lizzie Post and Daniel Post-Senning, thanks for telling our audience how to be polite.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lizzie Post:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Daniel Post-Senning:</strong> It’s so good to see you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> You’ve got some work to do on Brendan.</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<br /></div>","published":"2013-10-11T05:51:11+00:00","teaser":"Lizzie Post and Daniel Post-Senning, co-authors of “Emily Post’s Etiquette, 18th Edition,” are our main etiquette squeezes, even if we were recently caught with a different manners maven.
