Pinafore</em> and <em>Pirates of Penzance</em>. One listen to the \"Major-General's Song\" (which would later become the basis for one of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcS3NOQnsQM\">our favorite Tom Lehrer songs</a>) and it's clear these songs are not for the faint-of-tongue. See how much Gaiman remembers about the duo's 19th century operettas...and whether he can sing his answers.</p><p>Plus, Gaiman advises that everyone should have a hobby that could potentially kill them (his is beekeeping), and lends his voice to an extra-creepy rendition of Jonathan Coulton's \"Creepy Doll.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
