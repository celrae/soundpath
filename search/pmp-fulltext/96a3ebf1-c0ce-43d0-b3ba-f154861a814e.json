These are the moments when everything seems to click, and people leap forward into their careers.</em></p><p>It all started with a dead-end job at a convenience store in Pittsburgh. Terry Boring says he had the worst job there: the assistant manager.</p><p>\"You get none of the respect of the store manager and you get all of the terrible hours that they can't get anyone else to work,\" he says.</p><p>Boring was surrounded by fluorescent lights, old food and Slurpee machines. But the worst part was wearing the dreaded uniform.</p><p>\"It was like they got out of the time machine straight out of 1981. It's mint green and I had these pleated black slacks. I just looked like a sad joke,\" he says. \"It was not a fun place to work.\"</p><p>Boring's big break happened when one of the regulars named Gregg walked up to the counter to buy his usual pack of cigarettes.</p><p>Knowing that there was a deal going on at the store, Boring suggested he buy two packs instead of one.</p><p>\"I said, 'Listen, you come in every couple days, you buy a pack of cigarettes. You could buy two packs and save yourself some time and money.' \"</p><p>Gregg paused, smiled and asked him why he was working at a convenience store.</p><p>\"Most of my young and early adult life had been spent with a lot people telling me how much potential I was wasting and how I wasn't really living up to what I was capable of doing,\" he says.</p><p>Gregg, who worked in the sales department at a bank, saw something in Boring. He told him that he had a job opening and promised him that he'd put in a good word.</p><p>That evening, Boring applied and landed an interview. The hiring manager called back with a job offer.</p><p>\"By the way, this is not a glamorous job that I'm signing up for. It was the customer service representative job,\" Boring says. \"Which at the time, I was ecstatic about.\"</p><p>He immediately shared the news with Gregg.</p><p>\"I just told him, 'Thanks a lot for putting in a good word for me.' \"</p><p>Gregg looked at him and realized that he forgot to recommend him for the position.</p><p>Boring got the job all by himself.</p><p>\"It's really amazing what can happen when somebody believes in you,\" he says. \"Even if you don't believe in yourself.\"</p><p>Nine months into being a customer service representative, Boring worked his way up to the sales department where he set record numbers as the top salesman.</p><p>Now, seven years later, he's a vice president and the sales performance manager at the bank.</p><p>\"My big break is found in a most unexpected place,\" he says.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
