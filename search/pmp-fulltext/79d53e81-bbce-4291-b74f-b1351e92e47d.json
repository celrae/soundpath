When they come to this country, they're \"bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.''</p>\n<p>Felix Sanchez of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts said there couldn't be any tolerance for a public figure like Trump to get away with his comments. \"This is really bigoted behavior on the part of an avowed presidential candidate on the Republican side for the presidency of the United States.

But he also added that Univision's decison to drop the Miss USA broadcast was a breach of contract and that he (Trump) would take legal action against the broadcaster.  Then on Friday, it got personal: Trump declared his resort in Miami off limits to anyone associated with Univision.  </p>\n<p>Felix Sanchez said Univision's decision to drop the Miss USA broadcast was bold and courageous. \"I think you cannot service the Hispanic community and allow it to be mistreated. [Univision] had to take a step in support of their audience.\" He said it's also a victory for social media activism over what he terms the ho-hum reaction of the mainstream media. \"This is really civil rights leadership in the digital age. I don't think that there is a sufficient understanding outside of the Latino community as to how outrageous these remarks were. The media coverage of did not necessarily focus on the specific remarks. And it took over a week of social media activism at the grass roots level to boil this issue up to the top.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-06-25/immigrant-roots-link-six-2016-candidates\">Republican presidential candidates</a> have a history of making negative comments about Latinos, says Sanchez. \"Mitt Romney said that illegal immigrants that were here should self-deport and I think it's that phrasing, that language, the use of illegal, the use of alien, the lexicon of certain politicians on the right.\" Sanchez says it's the gradual buildup of negative statements that made Trump's comments intolerable. \"And this is just sort of the tipping point of where someone announces for the highest office in the land and they have no problem doing it, spewing refuse about the Latino community.\"</p>\n<p><script>\n<!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^https:/.test(d.location)?'https':'http';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+\"://cdn1.findthebest.com/rx/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"ftb-widgetjs\");\n//--><!]]>\n</script></p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-06-26%2Fblah-blah-blah&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn1.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/Trump_Miss_USA_Not.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://admin.pri.org/file/trumpmissusanotjpg"},{"href":"http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0626201505.mp3"},{"href":"http://admin.pri.org/file/0626201505mp3"}]}
