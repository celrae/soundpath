Most of them are more focused on target practice with their Kalashnikovs.</p><p>These troops rotate back and forth to the front, and right now, they're on a break.</p><p>Their commander, who goes by the nickname \"Mongol,\" says the separatists and the Russians have never observed the cease-fire.</p><p>\"They haven't stopped shelling,\" he says. \"They didn't pull back their heavy artillery, their tanks, their mortars â€” nothing. We moved all our stuff back 50 kilometers (30 miles), but they didn't.\"</p><p><strong>A Tenuous Truce </strong></p><p>The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe says <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/02/23/388378548/osce-needs-better-technology-to-monitor-ukrainian-truce-zannier-says\">both sides have blocked some access for observers</a>, so it's not fully possible to confirm that all heavy weapons have been pulled back, or that weapons aren't returned to the front when monitors aren't around.</p><p>Mongol charges that the separatists and their Russian allies have recently fired cluster munitions, shells filled with bomblets that often scatter and become a hazard to civilians.</p><p>Human Rights Watch says there's evidence that both sides have used cluster munitions.</p><p>Mongol sits with his men in an unfinished log building that serves as his headquarters.</p><p>On the wall behind him is the red-and-black banner of the Right Sector, the far-right political group that formed its own armed force to fight in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>The Russian media often accuses the Right Sector of being <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/05/03/309006428/russia-condemns-ukraine-with-comparisons-to-nazis\">neo-Nazi and fascist</a>, charges that Mongol shrugs off.</p><p>\"Patriots, we're just patriots. They say we eat kids, and all that, but it's just lies, and any sane person understands that,\" he says.</p><p>Mongol says the reason he joined the Right Sector militia is because it was the unit that was always closest to the front.</p><p>The fighters say they've been taking casualties nearly every day since the cease-fire officially began about a month ago.</p><p><strong>The Fighting Goes On</strong></p><p>The wounded come first to a makeshift medical station that is run by a cheerful woman who goes by the nickname \"Mama.\"</p><p>\"We get guys from the front line here, with concussions or shrapnel or gunshot wounds,\" she says. \"We stabilize them and send them on to a hospital.\"</p><p>The \"station\" is actually an old ambulance, donated to the region years ago by the fire department in Fairfax, Va.</p><p>And Mama is a 47-year-old grandmother who worked as an anesthesiologist at a maternity hospital before the war. She says she came to Pisky to be close to her son and husband, after they joined the Right Sector as medics.</p><p>\"Our whole family's here,\" she says.</p><p>Mama knows the risks. Not long ago, she says, she saw her son drive up and deliver a wounded man. The tires on his car had been shot out, and he was driving on the rims.</p><p>She watched as he got into another car and drove right back to the front.</p><p>Some of the medical treatment at the front is given by two Ukrainian Orthodox priests, striking figures in long black cassocks, with camouflage jackets and helmets.</p><p>\"It would be hard to be here without faith,\" says Father Olexandr Golovchenko. \"If you just look with physical eyes and put God away, there's no hope. If l look with God's eyes, there's hope everywhere, and even when guys are dying, no one dies in vain.\"</p><p>More than 6,000 people have been killed in a year of fighting in eastern Ukraine, and the shooting goes on.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
