Naturally, he's also a big fan of sharks. In this quiz, the funny guy sinks his teeth into some underwater trivia.","itags":["npr_api","340113255"],"guid":"dac6f1af-e6e4-43cf-bbde-133fea9ac3ad","contentencoded":"<p>Comedian Anthony Jeselnik takes pride in joking about the topics you shouldn't joke about. Throughout his career, he's developed a snarky onstage persona delivering material about death and disease at comedy clubs, the roasts of Donald Trump and Charlie Sheen, and on his Comedy Central show, <em>The Jeselnik Offensive</em>.</p><p>Jeselnik joined <em>Ask Me Another</em> host Ophira Eisenberg to discuss his comic style. Before earning the moniker \"the Dark Prince of Comedy,\" Jeselnik recalls trying to win over a crowd by mimicking his comedic idol, former Saturday Night Live writer Jack Handey. \"As a comedian, you start, and you start trying things, and the audience tells you what your next step is going to be,\" Jeselnik said. \"For me, the cockier I got, and the darker I got, and the meaner I got, the more the crowd followed that. So I thought, 'Okay, this is going to be a lot of fun.'\"</p><p>When asked what topics he was interested in being quizzed on, Jeselnik mentioned sharks. So in an <em>Ask Me Another</em> Challenge called \"Sharks With Snark,\" Jeselnik tackled questions about the underwater predators' appearances in popular culture, like the origin of the nickname Steven Spielberg gave the mechanical shark in <em>Jaws</em>.</p><hr /><h3>Interview Highlights</h3><p><strong>How his on stage persona differs from his off-stage persona</strong></p><p>People are very scared of me because they've seen the stage persona, and when they meet me, they're kind of taken off guard, and I like that. I want you to be scared so that I can be seem charming. People will be like, \"Oh, you're so nice.\" I'm like, \"I'm not that nice, you just think I'm gonna be really, really mean.\"</p><p><strong>Why no topic is off limits</strong></p><p>If something made me uncomfortable, I would take it as a challenge to try and make a joke about that. That's my only goal: to find things that you shouldn't joke about, and find a way to make a joke.</p><p><strong>Why his performance on Comedy Central's <em>Roast of Donald Trump</em> changed his life</strong></p><p>If I do badly on [the roast], then everything my life has been leading up to has been for nothing. Because this was my opportunity, and if it goes well, then I know I've been on the right path and things will continue to go well. So when I did well, people thought, \"Oh, you're going to get so cocky when the roast is over,\" because I was cocky before. But after the roast, I kind of calmed down, because I didn't have to be cocky â€” everyone knew.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
