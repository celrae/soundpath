Easy comparison shopping and widespread free shipping have sweetened the deal for many online shoppers.","itags":["npr_api","368026522"],"guid":"ef75a454-1d1f-4135-a112-644801971943","contentencoded":"<p>This weekend, Will Falls decided to skip the local mall near Raleigh, N.C., and shop online instead.</p><p>\"No standing in line, no finding a parking spot,\" he says. \"Just get comfortable and go at it.\"</p><p>Millions of Americans did the same — Falls helped contribute to an 8.5 percent increase in online shopping Monday compared with 2013, according to data from IBM.</p><p>That growth stands in contrast to an 11 percent drop in sales reported by the National Retail Federation at brick-and-mortar stores over the Black Friday weekend compared with a year ago.</p><p>\"I definitely believe there is cannibalization occurring from the perspective of online against the stores,\" says Bob Drbul, an analyst and managing director at Nomura Securities.</p><p>Of course, some of that cannibalization is going to the retailers' own online arms, he notes.</p><p>As for <em>how</em> consumers shopped online, most used desktop computers, which accounted for three-quarters of online sales — though the use of mobile devices rose sharply.</p><p>Another reason for the drop in in-store shopping this past weekend, Durbl says, is that retailers spread their Black Friday sales across the whole month of November.</p><p>Elle Phillips, a graphic designer from near Boise, Idaho, had family members visiting for Thanksgiving this past weekend. They took very different approaches to their holiday purchases, she says.</p><p>\"They wanted to go Black Friday shopping,\" says Phillips, 37. \"I prefer to avoid it at all costs.\"</p><p>Her brother-in-law headed for the hunting and camping retailer Cabela's at 4 a.m., Phillips says. He came back six hours later, with tales of a checkout line stretching to the back of the huge store.</p><p>\"It literally took him two hours just to get through to the register with a couple of hoodie sweaters,\" Phillips says. \"So that just sort of ... verified the reason why I don't go out on Black Friday.\"</p><p>Phillips, meanwhile, did her shopping online, including finding some new Doc Marten boots for her husband. She looked first for the best price on Amazon, \"and then I actually went straight to the manufacturer's website ... and I found an equally good price there, all with free shipping.\"</p><p>That kind of price shopping and free shipping is forcing profit margins down for retailers, says analyst Drbul. But he expects a strong holiday season nevertheless.</p><p>A big reason is that falling gas prices are putting more money in consumers' pockets.</p><p>This year, Drbul says, \"has the potential to be the best retail performance since 2011.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
