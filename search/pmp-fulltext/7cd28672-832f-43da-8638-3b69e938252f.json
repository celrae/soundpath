In <a href=\"http://impossiblefoods.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Impossible Foods</a>' case, its mission is to disrupt the $74 billion beef industry.</p>\n<p><strong>“</strong>It’s egregiously inefficient,” says Patrick Brown, the CEO of Impossible Foods.</p>\n<p>Brown is talking specifically about the big business of raising animals for food. He says, worldwide, animal farming is one the biggest consumers of water.</p>\n<p>“It’s using 30 percent of the entire land surface of earth,” he continues.</p>\n<p>And that land is being cleared to make room for cattle to graze and to grow feed crops, which brings us to Brown’s next point.</p>\n<p><strong>“</strong>It’s the biggest driver of biodiversity losses in the world,” Brown says. “Just to raise animals, to make cheeseburgers, it’s ridiculous.”</p>\n<p>We've been using animals to make food for about 10,000 years, Brown says, and that technology is outdated. Take off the cultural veneer and you’ll see “livestock is a technology. We use it to take cheap plant biomass” and turn it into meat.</p>\n<p>Or in layman’s terms: We grow and harvest tons of corn, grass and other plants and turn it into meat by feeding it to animals, which we then kill and package into chops and steaks.</p>\n<p>Brown says we don't need to do that any more. We now know how to extract nutrients and proteins from plants, and use those ingredients to make meat <em>without</em> animals. Enter Impossible Foods, one of a handful of tech start-ups that wants to make animal products, from cheese to eggs and beef, from plants.</p>\n<p>To show me what he’s talking about, Brown asks Beth Fryksdale, the food scientist in charge of making the plant-based meat.</p>\n<p><strong>“</strong>So I’m going to put the patty on the griddle here,” she says, plopping down two of Impossible Foods’ most recent burger prototypes. When the \"meat\" it hits the fry pan, it sizzles.</p>\n<p><strong>“</strong>You’ll notice we’ve got this nice transition in color from red to brown,” Fryksdale says, just like a real burger.</p>\n<p>I glance over at the plate the patty was on and I see ... blood?</p>\n<p>“Yup, it looks like blood although this is not blood from an animal, this is blood from plant,” Fryksdale says triumphantly.</p>\n<p><strong>“</strong>That’s the color of the 'heme' that I was talking about,” Brown interjects.</p>\n<p>Heme is a substance found on the roots of bean plants. It gives meat its unique flavor. It’s naturally red, and when you taste the heme raw, like I did, it tastes like blood.</p>\n<p>When the burger was done, I ate it. And If I’d tasted it at a fast-food joint, I probably wouldn’t have noticed a difference.
