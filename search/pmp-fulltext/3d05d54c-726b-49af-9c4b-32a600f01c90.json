You have boys and girls who have a first date and want to take their date to a special place.\"</p><p>And, he adds, \"You have an artist like me who wants to create something just incredibly poetic; and all that comes together. A good project generates new stories.\"</p><p>The path, which covers about a half-mile, opened last Wednesday as part of celebrations marking the 125th anniversary of the death of Van Gogh, who lived from 1853 to 1890. He lived in Eindhoven for a few years and used the town as a backdrop for his paintings.</p><p>As we reported last week, another Dutch town, Krommenie, installed <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/11/10/363023227/solar-bike-path-opens-this-week-in-the-netherlands\" target=\"_blank\">solar panels on a bike commuter path</a> outside Amsterdam.
