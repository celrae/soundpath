Hot dogs, probably the classic ballpark food. What is maybe the most interesting one?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><br />\n<strong>Sonia Chopra:</strong> There’s one in Baltimore that has crab mac ‘n’ cheese on top of it.<br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> <em>That’s</em> interesting.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><br />\n<strong>Sonia Chopra:</strong> I think my favorite hot dog is not really a hot dog&nbsp;—&nbsp;it’s called “The Churro Dog,” and it’s at the Arizona Diamondbacks stadium, and it’s a cinnamon churro served hot inside a long, chocolate-glazed doughnut.<br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-version=\"4\"><br />\n<div><br />\n<div></div>\n<br />\n<p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/z0eqF2LuwN/\" target=\"_top\">A photo posted by MLB Food (@mlbfood)</a> on Mar 4, 2015 at 12:56pm PST<br /></p>\n</div>\n<br /></blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><script src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\" async=\"\" defer=\"defer\" type=\"text/javascript\">\n</script><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Oh, no [laughs].</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sonia Chopra:</strong> And then it’s topped with frozen yogurt to make it a little healthier! &nbsp;Not whipped cream, not ice cream, but <em>frozen yogurt…</em>&nbsp;and also chocolate sauce and caramel sauce.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> A lot of these,&nbsp;actually… the thing that comes to mind is state fair food.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sonia Chopra:</strong> Exactly, yeah.
