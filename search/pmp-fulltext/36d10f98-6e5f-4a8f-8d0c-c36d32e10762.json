He would play for four hours and you just sort of went on this journey with them. You would start to listen to a song.

He didn’t want people ripping him off and Lou knew that people had ripped <em>him</em> off and he was very protective of <em>his</em> music. Both of them were paranoid. So, Lou and I walked into CBGB’s and Lou was carrying a cassette recorder. We may have been doing an interview.
