Seftel says that around this time he remembered his mother said she had always wanted her own show. So he thought, why not?</p><p>He started recording their FaceTime conversations, and posting them on YouTube. Seftel and his mother talk about pop culture, movies and fashion &#8212; and their videos have thousands of hits.</p><p>Ahead of this Mother&#8217;s Day weekend, Joshua Seftel and his mother, <strong>Pat Seftel</strong>, joined <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young to talk about their videos.</p><p><div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"\">It&#8217;s about two different generations finding a way to connect.<div class=\"pullquoteauth\">&ndash; Joshua Seftel</div></div></p><p>&#8220;I think the series is about connecting,&#8221; Joshua said. &#8220;It&#8217;s about two different generations finding a way to connect, and in every episode, we try to bring it to a personal level and really learn something about my mom.&#8221;</p><p>Some of the things he&#8217;s found out have been funny, like when he found out the origin of his middle name, Rand, during a discussion about Kanye West and Kim Kardashian&#8217;s baby daughter, North West.</p><p>&#8220;I was pregnant and I was driving down a street here in Schenectady, thinking about, &#8216;What am I gonna use for a middle name?&#8217;&#8221; Pat said. &#8220;And there was this store that sold Venetian blinds and window treatments, and it was Rand Blinds. And I said to myself, &#8216;Rand, Joshua Rand!&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>Pat says she has to do her homework to stay on top of all the and popular culture she and her son discuss.</p><p>&#8220;When I go to the beauty parlor, I read all the magazines, because I don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s gonna ask me,&#8221; she said.</p><p>And Joshua has noticed his mom carrying herself like the TV star she&#8217;s always wanted to be.</p><p>&#8220;She does a lot more prep with the makeup and hair these days,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The first few episodes, she didn&#8217;t care as much, but as the series has gotten a little bit more of a following, the hair has looked better and better.&#8221;</p><p>Most importantly, &#8220;My Mom On Movies&#8221; has been a way for Pat and Joshua to stay connected and become even closer &#8212; and Joshua said they&#8217;ve been inspiring viewers to do the same with their parents.</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve received a lot of email, letters, and from fans and people who watch the series, saying they&#8217;ve been inspired &#8212; that they&#8217;re either gonna buy their parents an iPad, or or they&#8217;re just going to call their parents and talk to them more,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And to me, that&#8217;s amazing.
