They’re actually normally $4 or $5, so it had tripled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> How do you put Kit Kats into pizza? Was it a dessert pizza, or was it like a pepperoni pizza?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Clarissa Wei:</strong> It was a mango pizza, so it was a dessert pizza with Kit Kat bars inserted inside.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That just brings up <em>more</em> questions. What does a mango pizza taste like?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Clarissa Wei:</strong> I don’t think I’ve ever had a mango pizza.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Just weird on top of weird. So in this market there are these baked Kit Kats. We’re gonna go in and buy some. Are they in more than one flavor?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Clarissa Wei:</strong> The baked Kit Kats come in two flavors: chocolate and pudding. But the one that I bought was pudding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> What is ‘pudding flavored’? It seems to me that pudding is something into which you put <em>many</em> different flavors.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Clarissa Wei:</strong> Like a flan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Okay, so maybe vanilla-y, creamy?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote data-pullquote=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Clarissa Wei:</strong> <q>It really just tastes like a sugary piece of sugar.</q></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> What could be wrong with that?

So we have two bags of baked Kit Kats. These are pudding flavor. How do we make these things?&nbsp; Because all of the instructions are in Japanese.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Clarissa Wei:</strong> So you’re gonna open them, and there’s 13 in each pack, and they come individually wrapped.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Of course — because if there’s one thing I’ve noticed about Asian packaging, it’s that every little portion of it has to be wrapped.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Clarissa Wei:</strong> Yeah. And so what you want to do is set the toaster oven…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> How hot are we gonna bake these at?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Clarissa Wei:</strong> The back of the package doesn’t say the temperature, so I did it at 375.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano</strong>: You just randomly hit upon that?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Clarissa Wei:</strong> I just randomly decided on that.</p>\n<br />\n<p>Okay, so you want to put four on the pan for two minutes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Can I try one of these just unbaked?

It tastes a little like a biscuit, but a lot of people think the wafer is what’s baking.&nbsp; But there’s already a cookie inside.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> It’s not like there’s raw dough inside of it, and that <em>that</em> is going to cook up like a cookie inside.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Clarissa Wei:</strong> No — and it’s funny, because a lot of the English publications wrote about this when it came out in March.

A roasted marshmallow. You’re now trying to get a piece of this off of the pan with a spatula, and… [laughing:] The two halves of the Kit Kat bar just separated and they’ve sort of come apart! So now we’ve got a mess of the charred candy outside of the Kit Kat, as well as the exposed inner wafer….</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Clarissa Wei:</strong> Try it though.
