Hear the conversation at the audio link, and read a few highlights below.</p><p><strong>On Bob Dylan's \"Wallflower\"</strong></p><p>\"I heard it on a bootleg series. I was driving around in British Columbia on a beautiful summer afternoon and I was listening to it with my children in the back, and I thought, 'Well, this is a song we should all be singing together in the car.' I loved it. There's so much truth and beauty in it. Simple, but it speaks to a lot of people.\"</p><p><strong>On The Mamas & The Papas' \"California Dreamin'\"</strong></p><p>\"I started working on that song listening to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/99735921/jos-feliciano\" target=\"_blank\">José Feliciano</a>, actually, not The Mamas & the Papas; it's been sort of sitting in the back of my mind since then. I think the really exquisite piece to the puzzle of finally recording it was having <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15412309/graham-nash\" target=\"_blank\">Graham Nash</a> singing on it. I could never say that Graham Nash sings 'background vocals,' but to have Graham Nash singing with me still kind of hits me like, 'Oh my gosh.'\"</p><p><strong>On <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15158238/paul-mccartney\" target=\"_blank\">Paul McCartney</a>'s \"If I Take You Home Tonight\" </strong></p><p>\"I had the great opportunity to work with Paul McCartney on a record he did called <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/03/29/148609721/paul-mccartney-blows-kisses-to-his-fathers-era\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Kisses on the Bottom</em></a>, which was a collection of songs he chose that meant a lot to him. In amongst these songs that he chosen, he had written a handful of romantic ballads and beautiful songs, like he does he so well. \"If I Take You Home Tonight\" was one of them and it just didn't make it on the record. I had to muster up the courage to say, 'Can I do this song?' And he said, 'Sure.' He told me he likes it, so that's really — I hit the ceiling.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
