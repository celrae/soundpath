It&#8217;s the women that teach the men what&#8217;s important in life.&#8221;</p><p>The affection apparent in Reiner&#8217;s films stems from an ethos of celebrating life until it&#8217;s over. Reiner may have learned it from his father, legendary writer and director Carl Reiner, and his friends.</p><p>&#8220;They liked to make each other laugh and I was very privileged to be around them and see how much they embraced and enjoyed life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anybody who makes humor for a living has a dark side, but there&#8217;s nothing better than trying to make people laugh.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"responsive-media\" style=\"\"><div class=\"secthead\" style=\"width:624px;\"><div class=\"sectheadtxt\">Video: 'The Princess Bride' swordfight</div></div><iframe class=\"shortcode-youtube\" width=\"624px\" height=\"376\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lC6dgtBU6Gs?rel=0&wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p><p><div class=\"responsive-media\" style=\"\"><div class=\"secthead\" style=\"width:624px;\"><div class=\"sectheadtxt\">Video: 'And So It Goes' trailer</div></div><iframe class=\"shortcode-youtube\" width=\"624px\" height=\"376\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/wbUdGTZ1uVs?rel=0&wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001661/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rob Reiner</strong></a>, actor, director and producer.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 WBUR-FM.
