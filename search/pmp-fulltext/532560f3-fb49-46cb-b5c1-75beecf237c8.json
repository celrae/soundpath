On NPR&#8217;s <em>On Point</em> this morning, he said:</p><p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">&#8220;Wealth levels above $100 million or $1 billion seem to be rising at 6 to 7 percent per year, you know, of course a middle class family doesn&#8217;t get that rate of return right now. So this creates a tendency toward excess concentration of wealth. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that we want to go to full equality of wealth. Right now, the bottom half of the U.S. population owns about 2 percent of U.S. national wealth. If it was full equality it should be 50 percent. I&#8217;m not saying it should be 50 percent, I&#8217;m just saying maybe we can do better than 2 percent.&#8221;</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://onpoint.wbur.org/2014/04/29/thomas-piketty-inequality-gregory-mankiw\" target=\"_blank\">Hear the On Point interview and read an excerpt of the book</a></li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 WBUR-FM.
