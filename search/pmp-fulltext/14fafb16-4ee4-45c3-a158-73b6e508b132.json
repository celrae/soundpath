While we had him here, we grabbed him up for a conversation about <em>Transparent </em>and pop culture debuts.</p><p>If you haven't seen <em>Transparent</em>, the basics are these: It's a ten-part family comedy-drama starring the super-great Jeffrey Tambor as a transgender woman named Maura navigating her transition with her sometimes awful adult children. Written by Jill Soloway, it was made available on Amazon streaming all at once a few weeks back, and we all very much enjoyed it (sorry if that's a spoiler). We talk about the large number of terrific actors who have terrific roles (including Friend Of NPR Carrie Brownstein), the show's subtle treatment of gender identity and sexuality both inside and outside Maura's story, the music that Stephen really loves, and lots more. (Vox also published a <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/10/16/6977705/transparent-interview-jill-soloway\" target=\"_blank\">fine and deep interview</a> with Soloway this week; I recommend it if you're interested in her thinking and her process.)</p><p>Our other topic this week is the pop culture debut, which — naturally — requires a chat about just what constitutes a debut, since most people, if you want to find the very very very beginning, start with something little enough that you've probably never seen it. But we wind up chatting about albums, novels, TV shows, and more.</p><p>As always, we close with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about a <a href=\"http://worstcats.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a> he loves and about a new <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/347139849/jazz-night-in-america\" target=\"_blank\">NPR Music project</a> you should definitely check out. Glen is happy about some new comics that he figures are here none too soon. Ari is happy about a book-buying binge designed to protect him from British spellings. I am happy about all kinds of things — a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/10/09/354529748/this-impromptu-dance-geoffrey-holders-son-tells-one-more-story\" target=\"_blank\">great essay</a> we ran at NPR, a <a href=\"http://killrockstars.bandcamp.com/album/same-sex-symbol\" target=\"_blank\">great album</a> I heartily recommend, and my compulsion to fantasy-cast a movie I'm really, really hoping will be very funny.</p><p>Find us on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pchh\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> or follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nprmonkeysee\" target=\"_blank\">me</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/idislikestephen\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ghweldon\" target=\"_blank\">Glen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/arishapiro\" target=\"_blank\">Ari</a>, producer <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jessica_reedy\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica</a>, and our pal <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/mikekatzif\" target=\"_blank\">Mike</a>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
