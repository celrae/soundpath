It's the brainchild of a British man who prefers to remain anonymous. He lived in the Gulf region for many years and only recently relocated back home home to the UK. He says satirists must make fun of ISIS.</p>\n<p>\"I think a lot of what we do is just purely to continue to ridicule what they're doing because, on one side, it's absolutely terrifying,\" he says. \"On another side, it's absolutely far-fetched and totally removed from reality. So I think it's our job as satirists to try and highlight that.\"</p>\n<p>He launched the satirical website in 2010, mainly to keep himself amused. \"People expect it to have started with some sort of grand plan to introduce satire to the region, but it really started just because it made me laugh. And the fact that it seems to have made other people laugh along the way is just a bonus really,\" he says.</p>\n<p>The editor says he chooses anonymity not for his own security, but rather for the mystique. \"I think if people found out who we actually were, it wouldn't be quite so interesting.\" Also, he and his fellow writers have full-time jobs and want to keep them. Many of The Pan-Arabia Enquirer's contributors are Arabs and Muslims based in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>\"The writers that send in stuff are out there on the ground and,\" he says, \"coming up with ideas and seeing what goes on around them. The area still holds a very special place in my heart.\"</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\"><p>Emirates to introduce shisha lounges onboard A380 fleet <a href=\"http://t.co/efNFs6kSL2\">http://t.co/efNFs6kSL2</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnThisDayLastYear?src=hash\">#OnThisDayLastYear</a></p>\n<p>— Pan-Arabia Enquirer (@arabiaenquirer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arabiaenquirer/status/465400272240386048\">May 11, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>The man says the site's <a href=\"http://www.panarabiaenquirer.com/wordpress/emirates-to-introduce-shisha-lounges-onboard-a380s/\">most popular story</a> was about how Emirates Airlines was going to introduce shisha lounges in first class on their A380 fleet, where passengers could smoke flavored tobacco from a communal hookah or water pipe.</p>\n<p>\"It's the sort of thing that if you think about it, it's obviously nonsense.
