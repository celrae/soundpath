I had no idea how good it was going to look when I first made it. I was quite amazed when I saw it from the [ski] lift.”</p>\n<p>An expert in orienteering, Beck uses a compass and set of sketches to measure how many steps will be needed for each part of the drawing before he sets out.</p>\n<p>Last month, Beck created a wolf howling at the moon at the Lake Louise Ski Resort in Banff, Alberta.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"446\" width=\"792\" alt=\"Simon Beck plots his course to begin his snow art project.\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/simon3.jpg?itok=63-hrszy\" title=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Simon Beck plots his course to begin his snow art project.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"image__credit\">\n    <span class=\"image__credit-label\">\n      Credit:\n    </span>\n    <p>Lake Louise Ski Resort</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>“It’s just like an orienteering exercise,” Beck says of the precision his designs require. “This is the same sort of process.\"</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"440\" width=\"782\" alt=\"Simon Beck making the outline of his howling wolf image.\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/simon2.jpg?itok=L7K2PnZS\" title=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Simon Beck making the outline of his howling wolf image.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"image__credit\">\n    <span class=\"image__credit-label\">\n      Credit:\n    </span>\n    <p>Lake Louise Ski Resort</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The images sometimes take more than 11 hours to make, and Beck can walk up to 30 miles while completing a single piece.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"427\" width=\"727\" alt=\"Simon Beck snowshoeing in circles to create image of a wolf howling at the moon.\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/simon1.jpg?itok=suHiQBqb\" title=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Simon Beck snowshoeing in circles to create image of a wolf howling at the moon.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"image__credit\">\n    <span class=\"image__credit-label\">\n      Credit:\n    </span>\n    <p>Lake Louise Ski Resort</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>His art lasts only as long as the conditions hold.
