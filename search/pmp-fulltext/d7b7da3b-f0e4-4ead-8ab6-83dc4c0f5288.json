The two parties signed an agreement just hours before their deadline. From Budapest, Stefan Bos reports.<br />\n<br />\n<hr />\n<br />\n<strong>STEFAN BOS:</strong> After days of heated debate, it seems that Belarus and Russia will keep Europe warm this winter, after signing a five-year contract for gas supplies.<br />\n<br />\nBelarus has reluctantly agreed to pay more than double the price it paid for gas in 2006. In 2007, Belarus will pay $100 per 1,000 cubic meters of Russian gas, up from $46 dollars last year.<br />\n<br />\nRussia had threatened to cut off supplies to Belarus if no deal was reached. In retaliation, Belarus planned to interrupt Russian gas supplies to the rest of Europe.<br />\n<br />\nDespite the agreement, Belarus's autocratic President Alexander Lukashenko isn't a happy man.<br />\n<br />\n[Lukashenko speaking Russian]<br />\n<br />\nHe says Russia \"already rose prices in the past. And then they say we have to be happy? It's blackmail.\"<br />\n<br />\nRobert Legvold, a Russia expert at Columbia University, says the tensions show that Moscow is not so committed to President Lukashenko.\n<blockquote><strong>ROBERT LEVGOLD:</strong> I don't think it means that they are about to begin forcing Lukashenko to transform the situation politically within Belarus, but I think it's a clear signal that they have their own separate interests and they are not about to simply give him large gifts because they want to be close.</blockquote>\nAnd concern remains in Europe over the longtime future of Russian gas supplies.<br />\n<br />\nIn Budapest I am Stefan Bos, For Marketplace.<br />\n<br /></div>","published":"2007-01-01T17:00:00+00:00","audio":[{"type":"image/jpeg","href":"http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-610x340/public/WWW/data/images/repository_orig/2006/12/29/20061229_belarus_gazprom.jpg?itok=LAYgpMCP","meta":{"width":"610","crop":"primary","height":"340"}},{"format":"MP3","meta":{"duration_hms":"00:08:26","api":{"href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm-audio:/marketplace/morning_report/2007/01/01_mktmorn0550","type":"application/json"},"duration":506},"href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/marketplace/morning_report/2007/01/01_mktmorn0550_64.mp3","type":"audio/mpeg"}]}
