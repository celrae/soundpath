We were shocked. In the '80s and '90s, as frontman for the band Soda Estereo, Cerati became the first pan-Latin American rock star — and he was only 55 when he died on Sept. 4.</p><p>This week, we play new music rooted everywhere from Colombia to Los Angeles and beyond. All the artists we play — on this week's show and elsewhere — owe a debt to Cerati. Soda Estereo was the first rock band to tour throughout the entire continent, and it proved that being a <em>roquero </em>could be profitable. Record labels took note and opened their doors to <em>rock en tu idioma</em>, in Spanish.</p><p>Next week on <em>Alt.Latino</em>, we'll record a tribute show celebrating Gustavo Cerati and his legacy — and we need you to help us out. What is your favorite Cerati song, live concert, or memory? Please leave your suggestions in the comments.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
