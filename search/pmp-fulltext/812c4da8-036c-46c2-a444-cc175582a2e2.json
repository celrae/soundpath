Bush. He seemed to have misunderstood the question and the &#8220;knowing what we know now&#8221; part, and backtracked in an interview a day later on conservative Sean Hannity&#8217;s radio show.</p><p>Then, at a town hall meeting in Nevada, a 19-year-old student confronted Bush on his comment that President Obama created ISIS, saying George W. Bush&#8217;s actions led to ISIS.</p><p>And Jeb Bush slipped and said he&#8217;s running for president, despite the fact that he has not officially declared his candidacy.
