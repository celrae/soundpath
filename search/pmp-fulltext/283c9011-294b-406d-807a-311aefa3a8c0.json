On her new album, <em>It's The</em> <em>Girls!</em>, she takes a crack at her favorites, from the tight harmonies of the '30s and '40s to the powerhouse Motown era, all the way to a fairly recent song — \"Waterfalls\" by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15807876/tlc\" target=\"_blank\">TLC</a>. Midler says for her, this album is a love story: She fell in love with music through these songs.</p><p>\"Each one of them meant something to me, for some reason,\" Midler says. \"[The Boswell Sisters'] 'It's the Girl' was the first 78 record I ever owned as a kid, and I had never heard music like that. I was very, very young — maybe 5 or 6 years old — but the sound of it was just mesmerizing to me.\"</p><p>For those familiar with the the Broadway version of <em>Hairspray</em>, the sound of <em>It's The Girls</em> might be familiar. Marc Shaiman, who wrote <em>Hairspray</em>'s music, is Midler's collaborator on these recordings and many others; she says they've been learning from one another since before he was even a legal adult.</p><p>\"He came to me when he was 16 years old,\" Midler says. \"He knocked on my door and he said, 'You don't know me, but I'm a musical prodigy,' or words to that effect, \"and I have to be in your world. ... When I heard your first record, it lit a fire under me that nothing had ever done before, because you were singing so many different kinds of music that I had never experienced. And I immediately went out to the record stores and gave myself a musical education.' \"</p><p>Midler says part of the fun of making <em>It's The Girls</em> was recontextualizing classic songs in ways that would surprise the listener. Giving The Supremes' \"You Can't Hurry Love\" a country-western twang was Shaiman's idea, but turning TLC's \"Waterfalls\" into an aching piano ballad was a reflection of how Midler had always taken the lyrics to heart.</p><p><strong>\"</strong>The first time I heard it, I burst into tears,\" she says. \"I understood it at a different level than maybe a lot of people heard it, because I had lost a lot of friends in the AIDS war. I felt that it was the song of a mother, when there really, literally is nothing you can do. And there's nothing sadder. And that's really my benchmark: If I cry when I hear a song, I don't care who tells me I'm not gonna sing it. I'm gonna sing it.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
