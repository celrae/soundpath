If it’s a sexual situation –</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Neither. You’d free neither.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> Yes, but if it’s a kidnapping situation, then pull out their gag so they can tell you where to catch the people who did it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I think it might be easier to remove someone who is bound when they’re not talking to you or screaming or expressing their frustration on what happened to them.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s true.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> No, I disagree, because you’ve got to get that gag out so you can know what’s going on, especially if somebody is creeping up behind you with a knife. They’re gonna say, “Watch out behind you!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Oh I see, I see.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> But they can’t do that if they’re gagged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> You need two pairs of eyes.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> Yeah, you’re happily undoing their arms…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> I like the idea of silence, like “You know what, we’ll get there in a second, let me just untie this knot.”</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> Yeah, and then meanwhile, this person comes up behind you and bangs you on the head.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Yeah, man. You’re not thinking like a pro.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> No, you have to think these things through. Gag first, hands second. You know what, gag first and then legs second because you want to be, you know –</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Mobile.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> Yeah, exactly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Oh mobile, oh I see.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s gonna be your bumper sticker: “Gag first, legs second.”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Well there you go, Vermont. Now you know.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> There you go, Vermont. Try not to get kidnapped.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Curious no more. Again, this does sound like you have some experience. Your books aren’t secretly nonfiction, are they?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> No, but I mean you could pick up the newspaper, I could pick up the newspaper any morning and read a three-line story, and I can turn that into a book.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Oh man, so the next one is gonna be about, you know, healthcare reform?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> No.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> Not that story.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> Actually it’s going to be about Afghanistan, so there you go.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> All right, looking forward to it. It’ll come out in about two weeks. Jackie Collins, thank you so much for telling our audience how to behave.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jackie Collins:</strong> Oh, behave well and have fun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br /></div>","published":"2014-01-24T03:58:54+00:00","teaser":"Each of Jackie Collins’ 29 books has hit the New York Times’ Best-Seller List – totaling over 500 million copies sold.
