When he signed with Columbia Records in 2009, Angelakos went from playing house parties in Boston to touring the world. Passion Pit's third album, <em>Kindred</em>, is out Tuesday, and there's more behind its sound than upbeat music.</p><p>\"I think Passion Pit's always been considered this project that is kind of melodramatic and deals with these very heavy issues with really happy music,\" Angelakos says. \"So there's a juxtaposition.\"</p><p>Angelakos has bipolar disorder — it's a condition he used to hide. But three years ago, after the release of his second album, his mental illness became hard to control. So he decided to stop hiding it.</p><p>\"I just didn't believe in lying about cancellations,\" he says. \"And I remember having to cancel a number of shows because I was hospitalized for I think about the fourth time. And I was like, 'This is what I deal with, and you can't lie.'\"</p><p>Today, Angelakos says he's better — and that his wife is a big part of the reason why. He dedicated the first song on <em>Kindred </em>to her.</p><p>\"'Lifted Up' is a song about my wife just coming to me at a point in my life where I really was pretty lost,\" he says. \"I was pretty dark. She's been one of the most amazing people, as a friend, as a partner in life.\"</p><p>Angelakos met his wife in school, and after a few years worked up the courage to talk to her. \"We just kind of hit it off, and she's always been very, very understanding of everything that I go through,\" he says.</p><p>He says many of Passion Pit's songs about his relationship have been skewed by difficult points in his mental health.</p><p>\"But instead of just apologizing, I wanted to express some type of gratitude,\" Angelakos says. \"Because that was really what I was also feeling, and I never really showed that side. I'm at a point where I'm still alive, so I've gone through quite a bit.</p><p>\"I'm so lucky and I'm healthy, so I can actually talk about more relatable, even more mundane subjects,\" he says. \"That is such a fantastic luxury for me at this point.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
