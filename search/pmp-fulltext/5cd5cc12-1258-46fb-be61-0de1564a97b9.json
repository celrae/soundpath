Israeli warplanes hit 50 purported militant sites and the cabinet of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorized the call-up of some 40,000 reservists, as Israel mobilized for its third large-scale military operation against the Gaza Strip in five years.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"NPR Israel Palestine \" href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/07/08/329754998/israel-expands-attacks-on-hamas-in-gaza\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>NPR</strong>: Israel Expands Attacks On Hamas In Gaza </a>&#8211; &#8220;&#8221;Israel called up some 1,500 reservists, which seemed to mean that Israeli officials believe the tensions with the Islamist Hamas in Gaza will continue. An Israeli army spokesman said that in the Israeli airstrikes overnight, Israel destroyed the homes of several senior Hamas military men.
