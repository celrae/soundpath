Shortly thereafter the Syrian uprising began, and then morphed into civil war. The country fell into chaos.</p>\n<p>Hassan didn't escape that chaos. He had already completed his mandatory military service, but he was called back to join the army of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. </p>\n<p>Hassan didn't want to sell his cows or join the army, but he didn't have much choice: The declining economy meant he was already losing money. Plus, Khudr says, he felt he didn't have anything to lose.</p>\n<p>\"[He joins the army] not because he wants to fight for his country or because he loves the army,\" Khudr says. \"In the end, he just gave up and went.\"</p>\n<p>Khudr himself was also caught up in the uprising. He began taking part in protests held by the opposition, and was arrested by government forces for a short while. Then he, too, was called to join the army.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-image_on_right\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/ALI2.jpg?itok=Emc0FzHA\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Filmmaker Ali Sheikh Khudr fled Syria after he was called to join the army.
