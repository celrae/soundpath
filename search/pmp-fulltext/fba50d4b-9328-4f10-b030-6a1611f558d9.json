Staffers from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum were on a fact-finding tour to Myanmar this spring and found what they call a genocide in the making. Andrea Gittleman, program manager for the Museum's Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide, says recent violence and persecution of Rohingya could be early warning signs of greater atrocities to come.","tags":["Conflict","Conflict & Justice","Asia","Myanmar","Rohingya people","Statelessness","Burma","Genocide","Rakhine State","Rohingya massacre","Social Issues"],"contentencoded":"<p>Andrea Gittleman had heard <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/opinion/the-persecution-of-the-rohingya.html?_r=0\">alarming reports of persecution and violence</a> against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, the mostly Buddhist country also known as Burma.

It was not the first such incident. Human Rights Watch reported on a move by Myanmar authorites to <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/22/burma-end-ethnic-cleansing-rohingya-muslims\">terrorize and forcibly relocate</a> the Rohingya in 2012-13. Anti-Rohingya riots forced an estimated 140,000 Rohingya to flee their homes.  </p>\n<p>\"In Rakhine state,\" says Gittleman, \"we spoke with ... people who reported how their neighbors came and burned their homes and attacked them and their families. Some of those people said that the police were actually involved in that. The government actors — some were physically present and involved in those acts of violence.\"</p>\n<p>Myanmar authorities have isolated the Rohingya in a program aimed at preventing radicalization by the Bangladesh-based militant<a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DI21Df06.html\"> Rohingya Solidarity Organisation</a>. Whether the RSO represents a real threat to Myanmar is <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/30/us-myanmar-rohingya-security-idUSKCN0JE0UZ20141130\">the subject of debate.</a> Myanmar has been constructing a fence that will eventually run along the entire 200-mile long border with Bangladesh, halting travel for Rohingya on both sides of the border.

It's a particular subset of human rights violations that can then lead to mass atrocities.\"</p>\n<p>As a flood of Rohingya refugees seeks asylum in southeast Asian countries, social media is awash with images of the boat people.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Death of Humanity.
