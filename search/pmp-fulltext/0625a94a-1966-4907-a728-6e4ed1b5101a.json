She&#8217;s the granddaughter of the original Redskins owner, George Preston Marshall. After years of mostly staying out of the debate, she&#8217;s come forward with an opinion: the Redskins name should go.</p><p><div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"\">&#8220;It&#8217;s time to move on.

But history and justice make strange bedfellows. It&#8217;s important to right a wrong. Nations have done it, team owners have done it and schools all over the country have done it &#8212; and I venture to say that they haven&#8217;t lost a fan because of it.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://whiskandquill.com/?page_id=2\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jordan Wright</strong></a>, writer and granddaughter of original Redskins owner George Preston Marshall.
