Not him.</p><p>\"I wanted to be like Dekalb Walcott Jr.,\" he says of his father.</p><p>So when his dad asked if he wanted to go on that call with him when he was 8, Dekalb was ecstatic. \"I'm jumping up and down, saying, \"Mom, can I go? Can I go?' \"</p><p>The excursion changed Dekalb's life, he tells his dad on a visit to StoryCorps. \"My eyes got big from the moment the siren went off,\" the younger Dekalb says. \"Ever since then, it was just like, 'This is the life that I want to live someday.' \"</p><p>Now 27, the younger Dekalb is living that life. He became a firefighter at 21 and went to work alongside his dad at the Chicago Fire Department. Before his father retired, the pair even went out on a call together â€” father supervising son.</p><p>\"You know, it's everything for me to watch you grow,\" his father says. But he also recalls worrying about one particular fire that his son faced.</p><p>\"I received a phone call that night. [And they said], 'Well, your son was at this fire.' I said, 'OK, which way is this conversation going to go?' \" Dekalb Walcott Jr. recalls.</p><p>\"And he said, 'But he's OK. And he put it out all by himself. Everybody here was proud of him.'</p><p>\"And the word went around, 'Who was out there managing that fire? Oh, that's Walcott! That's Walcott up there!' So, you know, moments like that, it's heaven on Earth for a dad.\"</p><p>The younger Dekalb says he's proud of being a second-generation firefighter. \"You know, kinda makes me look forward to fatherhood as well, because [I'm] definitely looking to pass that torch down to my son.\"</p><p><em>Audio produced for</em> Morning Edition <em>by Jasmyn Belcher Morris. </em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
