Think of your favorite bottom-scraping vocalist and the lyrics he or she interprets.</p><p>But while touches of nostalgia and longing seep into both the words and the way he sings them, Aubele can also wrangle a shy smile and a whimsical raised eyebrow with that deep, emotive voice. It's perfect for his own expressive lyrics, which he sings in both Spanish and English â€” sometimes in the same song. And don't even get me started on his guitar playing.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"Laberinto Del Ayer\"</li><li>\"This Song\"</li><li>\"Somewhere Else\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Felix Contreras, Denise DeBelius; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Denise DeBelius, Gabriella Garcia-Pardo, Olivia Merrion; photo by Jim Tuttle/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
