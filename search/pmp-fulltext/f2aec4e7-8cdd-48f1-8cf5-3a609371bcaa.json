But he&#8217;s also an active musician, playing guitar and banjo, and singing and writing songs. Helms and his friends <strong>Ian Riggs</strong> and <strong>Jacob Tilove</strong> have been playing together since their Oberlin College days.</p><p>Their music is, as Helms tells <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now</a></em>&#8216;s Robin Young, &#8220;sort of bluegrass, a little bit of folk and lovelorn country.&#8221; Now <a href=\"http://thelonesometrio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lonesome Trio</a>, as they call themselves, are touring, and on Tuesday, they release their <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WTNHJXM?tag=smarturl-20\" target=\"_blank\">self-titled debut album</a>.</p><p>The trio was a musical outlier at Oberlin, Helms said, where there wasn&#8217;t much of a folk or bluegrass scene to speak of.</p><p>&#8220;We were there in the late &#8217;90s, and there were a lot of rock bands and we even played in some rock bands,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ian was in the conservatory for jazz bass studies. And there was phenomenal music everywhere at Oberlin, that&#8217;s part of it&#8217;s identity. But there was kind of a void in the bluegrass or folk area.&#8221;</p><p>The group came together in Helms&#8217; sophomore year, when he was roommates with Tilove.</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really an earnest music show. That said, it&#8217;s also pretty lighthearted and fun.&#8221;<div class=\"pullquoteauth\">&ndash; Ed Helms</div></p><p></div></p><p>&#8220;Then we roped in Ian because he was a great jazz bass player,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That was a loose collective. There were a lot of people in and out of that group.&#8221;</p><p>Helms said that while the group&#8217;s shows don&#8217;t lean heavily on comedy, its music isn&#8217;t short on fun.</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been pretty straightforward about the presentation of our show,&#8221; Helms said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really an earnest music show. That said, it&#8217;s also pretty lighthearted and fun. Some of the music is &#8211; it&#8217;s not comedy music at all &#8211; but there are some sort of sly, cheeky songs, and those are fun.&#8221;</p><p>Ironically, Helms said, it&#8217;s usually Tilove who&#8217;s behind the group&#8217;s more comedic songs.</p><p>&#8220;This is a joke between us, but the music I write is much more maudlin,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Jake, on the other hand, writes these sort of up-beat, funnier tunes.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"secthead\"><div class=\"sectheadtxt\">Watch Ed Helms' valedictory speech at UVA:</div></div>        <div  class=\"l-article-media\" style=\"\">            <div class=\"responsive-media\" style=\"\">                <iframe style=\"\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AInPI6pRBY\"></iframe>            </div>        </div></p><p>Helms made headlines last month for his valedictory speech at the University of Virginia, which included comments about <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2015/04/06/rolling-stone-uva-columbia-report\" target=\"_blank\">Rolling Stone&#8217;s retracted story</a> &#8220;A Rape on Campus&#8221; and its subsequent impact on the university. He said, &#8220;It has been said that a rolling stone gathers no moss. I would add that sometimes a rolling stone also gathers no verifiable facts or even the tiniest morsels of journalistic integrity.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;d given a couple of commencement speeches before, and I try to have some comedy in there but say something meaningful at the same time,&#8221; Helms said. &#8220;In this case, it just felt like if I didn&#8217;t address what this student body had been through, and what this UVA community had been through, then I was sort of backing out or just not really doing my job.&#8221;</p><p>Helms&#8217; band mates supported the comments, with one caveat.</p><p>&#8220;I was proud of Ed for commenting on that, but I wish that he had done it after Rolling Stone reviewed the album,&#8221; Riggs joked.</p><p>So what about people who come to a Lonesome Trio show expecting to see Andy Bernard from &#8220;The Office&#8221; or Dr. Stu Price from &#8220;The Hangover&#8221;?</p><p>&#8220;I think if you came in expecting a comedy show, you would leave having not seen a comedy show, but hopefully feeling excited about the music show that you saw,&#8221; Helms said.<a name=\"song-list\"></a></p><p><style>                .abody div iframe.mp-iframe { margin:0; }                .abody .mp-alignleft {float:left; width:50%; margin:10px 10px 0 0; }                .abody .mp-alignright {float:right; width:50%; margin:10px 0 0 10px; }            </style>            <div class=\"l-article-media mp-player-wrap \">            <script type=\"text/javascript\">                document.domain = \"wbur.org\";            </script>            <div class=\"mp-iframe-wrap\">                <iframe class=\"mp-iframe\"                    width=\"100%\" height=\"122\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\"                    src=\"//embed.wbur.org/player/hereandnow/2015/06/11/pigeon-foot-lonesome-trio?title=Web Extra: Hear The Lonesome Trio perform 'Pigeon's Foot'\">                </iframe>            </div></div><ul><li>See a video of The Lonesome Trio&#8217;s visit on our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HereAndNowRadio/videos/vb.22100945733/10153316571185734/?type=2&theater\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook page</a> or <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/3ylRvhy9cl/?taken-by=hereandnowradio\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></li><li><a href=\"http://thelonesometrio.com/tour/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lonesome Trio&#8217;s tour dates</a></li></ul><h4>Songs In This Segment</h4><ul><li>Earl Scruggs, “Foggy Mountain Breakdown” performed by Ed Helms</li><li>Jacob Tilove, “Pigeon’s Foot” performed by The Lonesome Trio</li><li>Ed Helms, “Let it Ride” performed by The Lonesome Trio</li><li>Ed Helms, “Whiskey Drink” performed by The Lonesome Trio</li><li>Jacob Tilove, “Appalachia Apologia” performed by The Lonesome Trio</li><li>Avis Burgeson, Christiansen, Harry Dixon Loes “This Little Light of Mine” performed by Ed Helms and The UVA Hullabahoos</li><li>Ian Riggs, “River in the Gutter” performed by Ed Helms</li></ul><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1159180/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Ed Helms</strong></a>, guitarist and singer for The Lonesome Trio, and an actor.
