It's true that <em>Orange </em>has comedic elements, but so do <em>The Good Wife</em> and <em>Breaking Bad</em>. If the idea of those categories is for like to battle like, where do you draw the line? And how does that affect people doing great work in traditionally defined comedies, like Amy Poehler, given the long history of bias against comedy when (as at the Oscars) comedy and drama are in direct competition?</p><p>Even stranger, though — certainly more arbitrary — is the distinction between drama series and miniseries, particularly in the age of the anthology show, where the show continues, but the cast and the story are new every season. <em>Fargo </em>and <em>True Detective </em>are essentially structured the same way, and even though <em>Fargo </em>has more episodes, it is competing (and heavily nominated) as a miniseries, while <em>True Detective </em>is competing (and heavily nominated) as a drama series.</p><p>We'll have plenty of Emmy coverage in this space as the week continues, but for now, enjoy the Linda And Linda Chat Show about \"category creep\" and my dream of a Jon Hamm surprise victory.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
