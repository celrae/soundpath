In other parts of the country, scores of people are trying to get a peek inside historic and abandoned buildings. They post photos on sites like Instagram and tag them with hashtags like urbex for urban exploration.

Tusman's group partners with property owners to give what they call managed access. The idea is essentially, \"Hey, you don't need to trespass. We'll let you in.\"&nbsp; As an added draw, Hidden City puts art installations inside some of these vacant buildings. The hope is it'll open some doors.</p>\n<p>\"People might find a new use for a space that way, someone that might want to rent it, a developer that is interested in having some partnership in the area,\" says Tusman.</p>\n<p>Then there are people like Matthew Christopher, who started <a href=\"http://www.abandonedamerica.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Abandoned America</a>, a website featuring photos of abandoned sites across the country. Lately he's been hosting photography workshops inside old factories and retired cruise ships. \"I think if people have legitimate means to go in and experience a place, nine out of 10 people are going to want to do it that way,\" Christopher says.</p>\n<p>But realtor Chip Watts gave people access to the Thomas Jefferson Hotel for three years, and things still went horribly wrong. People broke in to the place dozens of times, stealing stuff and vandalizing the hotel.</p>\n<p>\"We even had people that got into the property at night and shot off fireworks off the roof, and we even had a base jumper that jumped off the tower,\" Watts says.</p>\n<p>So he cut off access, put up boards and fences, and got bigger locks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But in the end, things seem to have worked out. The Thomas Jefferson Hotel is now under contract.</p></div>","contenttemplated":"[{\"type\":\"text/html\",\"content\":\"<p>Imagine trying to sell a big historic building.
