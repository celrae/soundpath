His wife, Wendy&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">Mok, grew up there and lived through the city&#39;s handover from British to Chinese rule. But coming &quot;home&quot; has been challenging for both of them.</span></p><p>&ldquo;When I first came back, I had to adjust,&quot; Mok says. &quot;It&rsquo;s not easy, because the Hong Kong I came back to is very different than the Hong Kong I left. There&rsquo;s an influx of mainland Chinese tourists that are everywhere, so there&#39;s almost like a clash between Chinese.&rdquo;</p><p>For the past few days, Schroeder and Mok have been watching that clash play out on the streets of Hong Kong as pro-democracy protesters have challenged China&#39;s grip on the territory. <span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">And Schroeder says the protest movement has surprised him.</span></p><p>[[{\"fid\":\"74827\",\"view_mode\":\"original_image\",\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"height\":1224,\"width\":1632,\"alt\":\"This Hong Kong bus, along with a few others, has been parked in the middle of a Mong Kok street since Sunday.

They simply will not listen.</span></p><p>But Mok supports the demonstrations.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&ldquo;For the past few days I&rsquo;ve been very proud to be a Hong Konger,&rdquo; Mok said. She&#39;s</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&nbsp;impressed by how organized and polite the protesters seem to be. While visiting one neighborhood where protesters were stationed, she was offered water and a &ldquo;democracy pear.&rdquo;</span></p><p>&ldquo;People are very nice to each other,&rdquo; said Mok, who found this a stark contrast with the Hong Kong she encountered when she first returned, two years ago.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">&ldquo;Some people have called it an Occupy movement,&quot; Schroeder says. &quot;I don&rsquo;t think of it as an Occupy movement, I think of it as a &lsquo;Take Back Our City&quot; movement.</span></p><p>[[{\"fid\":\"74830\",\"view_mode\":\"original_image\",\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"height\":1224,\"width\":1632,\"alt\":\"Protestors gather in Mong Kok.
