We spend some time with the first 13-episode run this week, joined by our friend Kat Chow, of NPR's Code Switch. Kat recently wrote <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2015/03/26/395127808/why-its-so-hard-for-us-to-agree-about-dong-from-the-unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt\" target=\"_blank\">an excellent piece</a> about some of the complicated questions around race that the show's diverse cast has raised, and we do get into those questions. But we also talk about \"Pinot Noir,\" the extensive use of types, joke density, and lots more.</p><p>Then we move on to the tricky question of when culture is simply inspired lovingly by its influences and when it gets to the point where it's called \"derivative.\" We connect this to music and books as well as television, and we try to figure out when the hairs on the backs of our necks stand on end and we start to mutter, \"Well now <em>that's </em>just swiped.\"</p><p>As always, we close with what's making us happy this week.

Kat is happy about <a href=\"http://the-toast.net/2015/03/24/john-cho-boyfriend/\" target=\"_blank\">a piece</a> that made her grin and gave considerable inspiration to some of the rest of us as well.
