The melon can be cut like pizza into slices.</p><p><em>Serves 2 to 4.</em></p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><p>1 large slice watermelon, about 1 inch thick</p><p>1 tablespoon olive oil, plus 3 tablespoons</p><p>1/2 cup feta cheese, cut into small squares</p><p>1/3 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped</p><p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p><p>1 1/2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p>Heat grill to hot.

Serve at room temperature. Everyone cuts off their own slice.</p><h4>Watermelon, Crab and Arugula Salad</h4><p><strong>Kathy’s Note:</strong> The sweet juiciness of watermelon is delicious in a salad with sharp greens like arugula. Add sweet fresh crabmeat, lightly tossed with a chive vinaigrette, and you have a main course salad. Of course you can always omit the crab and you’ll still have a delicious salad.</p><p><em>Serves 2 to 4.</em></p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><p><em>The Vinaigrette:</em></p><p>1/2 teaspoon mustard</p><p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p><p>1 tablespoon fresh chives, minced</p><p>1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice</p><p>1 1/2 tablespoons white or red wine vinegar</p><p>1/4 cup olive oil</p><p><em>The Salad:</em></p><p>1 cup arugula</p><p>1 cup pea shoots or micro greens</p><p>1 cup watermelon flesh cut off rind and cut into 1 inch long pieces</p><p>1 pound fresh crabmeat</p><p>1 tablespoon fresh chives minced</p><p>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p>Make the vinaigrette: in a small bowl whisk together the mustard, salt, pepper, chives and lemon juice. Add the vinegar and then the oil and taste for seasoning.</p><p>Make the salad: Arrange the arugula and pea shoots on a large plate. Place the watermelon in a circle on the inside.</p><p>Place the crab in a small bowl and add 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette. Toss gently. Mound the crabmeat in the center of the plate. Sprinkle salt and pepper on the watermelon and crab. <a name=\"salsa\"></a>Drizzle a few tablespoons of the vinaigrette over the greens and watermelon or serve on the side.</p><h4>Watermelon and Roasted Cherry Salsa</h4><p><strong>Kathy’s Note:</strong> A fruity salsa that is ideal to serve with grilled fish, seafood, chicken, or kebobs. The salsa is also excellent with corn chips, particularly blue corn chips. Don’t make more than an hour or so before serving.</p><p><em>Serves 4.</em></p><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><p>1 cup pitted cherries (cut in half and remove pit)</p><p>1 tablespoon olive oil</p><p>1 1/2 cups watermelon cut into chunks</p><p>1 cup ripe tomatoes, cut into small chunks</p><p>1/2 cup sweet green pepper, cut into small pieces</p><p>Dash hot pepper sauce, like Sriracha or Tabasco, to taste</p><p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Toss cherries with olive oil in a small ovenproof skillet or roasting pan. Roast on the middle shelf for 10 minutes. Remove and let cool.<a name=\"pickled-rind\"></a></p><p>In a bowl gently toss the watermelon, roasted cherries, tomatoes, pepper, hot sauce, salt and pepper to taste.</p><h4>Pickled Watermelon Rind</h4><p><strong>Kathy’s Note:</strong> You buy a big beautiful watermelon. You eat all the sweet flesh and then you’re getting ready to throw away the rind. STOP! Keep the rind to make these delicious pickles. They take about 20 minutes to make and will keep in your refrigerator for several weeks. Serve with cheese platters, grilled ribs, burgers, chicken or seafood. They are particularly good served with rich foods as they are light, fruity and refreshing.</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p>4 cups watermelon rind</p><p>2/3 cup sugar</p><p>2 inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into 5 pieces</p><p>2 tablespoons Kosher salt or canning salt</p><p>1/2 tablespoon black peppercorns</p><p>1/2 tablespoon coriander seeds</p><p>1 dried Serrano chile, crumbled with or without seeds, depending if you like your pickles with a little spice or not</p><p>1 cinnamon stick, cut in half lengthwise</p><p>1 cup seasoned rice wine vinegar</p><p>1 1/2 cups cold water</p><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><p>Cut the dark green exterior of the rind off and then cut the pale white pieces into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Place the rind in a medium saucepan. Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and place a small plate on top of the rind to keep it submerged in the pickling liquid in the pot; let cool one hour.</p><p>Place the rind and all the pickling liquid and spices into a large canning jar(s) and seal. <a name=\"juice\"></a>Place in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or so. Serve cold.</p><h4>Watermelon Juice</h4><p>This is so easy and has so many possibilities. You can drink the juice as is. You can add it to lemon or limeade. You can freeze it in a Popsicle mold (with touch of lemon juice) or make drinks adding rum, vodka, tequila and seltzer.</p><p>Cut a large wedge of watermelon so you have 4 cups watermelon chunks. Place in a blender. Puree the watermelon using the on and off button and using a soft spatula to move chunks down into the blades. Strain through a fine sieve. Place in a glass jar and seal tightly and place in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.kathygunst.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kathy Gunst</a></strong>, resident chef for <em>Here & Now</em> and author of “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Notes-Maine-Kitchen-Seasonally-Inspired/dp/0892729171/?tag=wburorg-20\" target=\"_blank\">Notes from a Maine Kitchen</a>” and the video series “<a href=\"http://www.craftsy.com/class/simple-soups-from-scratch/4850;jsessionid=76CAA4F47028819E3BD2CB0F917EDC52.enya002\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Soups from Scratch</a>.” She tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mainecook\" target=\"_blank\">@mainecook</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
