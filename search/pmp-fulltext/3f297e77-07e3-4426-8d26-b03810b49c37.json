Harrison's ties to New Orleans run deep, musically and culturally. His work has long echoed strains of Mardi Gras Indian chants and street beat - not surprisingly as his late father was Big Chief of the Guardians of the Flame tribe, a position Donald Jr. has since assumed. Wendell and Sherman Holmes, plus longtime friend Popsy Dixon make up the Holmes Brothers, a vocal group best known for putting their personal stamp on blues, gospel, country, pop and more. The brothers join us to talk about the transition from Christ Church, Virginia to New York and back again to home and family.","contentencoded":"<span>Easter weekend is a time for reflection and family, and our guests certainly fit the bill.&nbsp;</span><strong>Donald Harrison, Jr.</strong><span>&nbsp;is a saxophone player and New Orleans native now based in New York.
