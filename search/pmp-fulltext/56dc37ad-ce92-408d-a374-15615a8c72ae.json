There aren’t enough beds for everyone, so they share, four or five to a bed.  </p>\n<p>The babies, some of them wrapped in blankets, lie in the middle. Young mothers sit in blood-streaked, thin, white hospital gowns that curl up on their sides.</p>\n<p>On my first visit to Fabella Hospital, I find out 77 infants already have been born here today. It’s only late afternoon. More mothers and newborns arrive every half hour or so. It’s so busy here that Filipinos commonly refer to this hospital as the “baby factory.” </p>\n<p>Inside the maternity ward, no one is getting any sound sleep. “We chose to deal with this type of situation because it’s cheaper here,” says one mom, Jaisel Anne Osmena, 20.</p>\n<p>Most of the women who give birth at Fabella come from poor communities around Manila. Here, they only have to pay what they can afford.</p>\n<p>“Sharing a bed is fine, it’s okay to share and be all together,” Osmena says. “But it’s tough because what if the person next to you is sick? What if they pass that illness on to you and your baby?”</p>\n<p>During the interview, I hear a commotion across the ward. I find out one of the babies has fallen out of a bed. I’m on the other side, so I can’t see what’s happened, but the nurses say everything is okay — at least this time. </p>\n<p>“We’re all crowded in the beds, it’s like we’re sardines in a can, tightly packed,” says Carina Dagdagan. She’s 19 years old and just had her second child. Her husband is a barber who makes about $10 a week. </p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-image_on_right\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/Sonia%20Narang_Fabella%20Hospital_photo4_0.JPG?itok=WUSBPC8q\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Mothers sit on benches at the front of the ward to breastfeed and calm their newborns.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"image__credit\">\n    <span class=\"image__credit-label\">\n      Credit:\n    </span>\n    <p>Sonia Narang</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Fabella Hospital is ground zero of the Philippines’ overpopulation crisis. The nation’s lowest-income families have little or no access to birth control, since it’s not widely available for free. This lack of government-subsidized birth control has kept the country’s fertility rate high.</p>\n<p>Former Congresswoman Risa Hontiveros says the big question is:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If you had just a minimum wage in a day would you spend it for a pack of pills or a pack of condoms, or would you spend it for a kilo of rice?” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Of course, rice,” she answers. “So, how can we make poor women and couples make that choice?” continues Hontiveros, co-author of the Philippines’ Reproductive Health Bill, designed to make contraception free at public health facilities. </p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_no_border cta_align-left cta_no-icon cta_bg-white cta_border\" data-entity-id=\"76482\" data-entity-title=\"Story Act Infographic\" data-entity-type=\"node\"><aside class=\"node node-story-act contextual-links-region story-act-cta story-act-nid-76482 cta-type-custom-text view-mode-entity_embed\" data-tracking-code=\"story-act-infographic\"><div class=\"field-body\">\n\n<div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"346\" width=\"432\" alt=\"Infographic birth control\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/unintendedpreg_2.jpg?itok=zdwWXS9t\" title=\"\" /><br /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n<p>Credit: David Conrad</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>  </p></aside></div>\n<p>In this predominantly Catholic nation, the bill faced extreme opposition for years.

She went to a local woman who uses stomach massage and misoprostal pills, a drug that can induce abortions.</p>\n<p>“It was painful, it was really, really painful,” says Endoso. “Even now, I can still feel the pain.
