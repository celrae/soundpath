(From her early comment that one of the prequels should be subtitled \"Three Hours Closer To Death And Nothing To Show For It,\" you can tell she's serious about those chops.) (And the way she says, \"I'm <em>Trek</em> not <em>Wars</em>!\") We also talk quite a bit about diversity in casting, and I mention a story about <em>Noah</em> that you can read <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/co-screenwriter-of-noah-explains-why-there-are-no-black-people-or-poc-in-the-film\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>We also jump into the topic of <em>Louie</em>, FX's decorated, widely admired comedy centered around Louis CK. We talk about the positives, the drawbacks, and a little nonspoilery business about the new season. (Well, a little spoilery as to the first two episodes that have already aired. Otherwise much less so.) Petra mentions a cat picture she worked on while she was watching the <em>Louie</em> episodes. You can see that picture at the bottom of this post.</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is very happy about a musical theater production about which he is completely unbiased, in the sense that one of his blood relatives is in it. He's also happy about <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/05/04/307765618/first-listen-sylvan-esso-sylvan-esso\" target=\"_blank\">a record</a> you can actually listen to. Petra is happy about a <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/57803-his-fair-assassin\" target=\"_blank\">book series</a> she really loves (you must hear her description). Glen is happy about <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17934370-the-undertaking-of-lily-chen?from_search=true\" target=\"_blank\">a book</a> that sounds equally interesting and surprising. I am happy about a small grab bag of things: Stephen writing about <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2014/05/02/308731559/the-good-listener-is-it-fair-to-call-a-band-a-sellout\" target=\"_blank\">sellouts</a>, a giant toy I got in the mail, and Dave Holmes' <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/news/somewhere-in-time/\" target=\"_blank\">Somewhere In Time</a> column.</p><p>Find us on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pchh\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> or follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nprmonkeysee\">me</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/idislikestephen\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ghweldon\" target=\"_blank\">Glen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/petramatic\" target=\"_blank\">Petra</a>, producers <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jessica_reedy\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/lmigaki\" target=\"_blank\">Lauren</a> and <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nickfountain\" target=\"_blank\">Nick</a>, and our dear pal <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/mikekatzif\" target=\"_blank\">Mike</a>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
