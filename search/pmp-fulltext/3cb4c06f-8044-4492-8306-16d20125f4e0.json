Walters carries styles that go back decades and shoes up to size 18. Its outsize selection has the attention of NBA stars, and Atlanta-based hip-hop stars including Jermaine Dupri and Ludacris have memorialized the store in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5W73HaVQBg\">music video</a>.</p><p>Walters is also an institution that attracts celebrities, which led to confrontation. In 2010, associates of rival Atlanta rappers Gucci Mane and Young Jeezy <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/entertainment/music/gucci-mane-jeezy-posses-allegedly-fire-shots-dow-1/nQc4n/\">ran into each other and mixed it up</a>, according to the <em>Atlanta Journal Constitution</em>.</p><p>Walters employee Patrick Morrison is nonchalant about the store's fame.</p><p>\"People come to certain places. It's just the way it is,\" he says, \"you just can't explain it.\"</p><p><em>Thanks to independent producer Susanna Capelouto and Georgia Public Radio's Eboni Lemon.
