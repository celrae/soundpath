J.J. Cale’s one of my favorite, favorite, favorite people to listen to, especially when I’m cooking.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Gideon Bensen:</strong> It’s something that people can switch off to and listen to or you can talk amongst yourselves.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Isabella Manfredi:</strong> My favorite J.J. Cale track is this song called “Lies.” He’s the guy who wrote “Cocaine,” everyone knows that song. He was a big influence on Eric Clapton. He’s a master of understated, beautiful, efficient guitar work. It’s such a groovy song. I don’t know if you guys say groovy. It’s kind of lame to say groovy. Funky. It’s such an angry song but he’s so cool about it. That’s the kind of man that he was. He wasn’t really in it for the fame and the glory and all of that sort of stuff.</p>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Nick Drake, “Saturday Sun”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YP9i58UZTsQ\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Gideon Bensen:</strong> I guess I’d say this dinner party, whatever it turns into, I’d kind of play maybe a little bit of Nick Drake.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Isabella Manfredi:</strong> Really? You want to send everybody to sleep?</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Gideon Bensen:</strong> No, it’s not sending everyone to sleep. I just think it’s something you can listen to while still chatting over. I don’t think everyone’s quite ready, the couple in the room aren’t quite ready to get up and have a little ballroom dance in the corner yet.</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<h2>The 101ers, “Keys to Your Heart”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/i9hBmf5-qg8\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Isabella Manfredi</strong>: I’d probably kick off. I’d probably, after that, I’d probably kick off with something like “Keys To Your Heart” by 101ers. 101ers was Joe Strummer from The Clash. One of his early bands. The song’s called “Keys To Your Heart,” I think it was one of the first songs he pretty much ever wrote. And he muscled his way into that band.

Get out of here.”&nbsp;It’s one of those songs where you kind of know what he’s saying but it’s a little bit ambiguous.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Gideon Bensen:</strong> Part of why you like it is you don’t completely know what he’s saying.</p>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br />\n<h2>The Preatures, “Dark Times”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/rVd2xszQbY4\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Isabella Manfredi:</strong> And if people at their dinner party’s wanna play our track, we would probably suggest one of Gideon’s.
