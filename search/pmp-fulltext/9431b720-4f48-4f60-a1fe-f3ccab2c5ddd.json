Niswanger's alto- and soprano-sax mastery is captivating. Now 25, she's just released her third album as a bandleader, <em>PDX Soul</em>, and is preparing to go on tour with fellow Portland, Ore., native <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/90478159/esperanza-spalding\">Esperanza Spalding</a>.</p><p>The funk-influenced <em>PDX Soul,</em> which finds Niswanger embracing heavy production and certain elements of smooth jazz, represents a departure from her straight-ahead jazz albums.</p><p>\"I wanted to show another side of my passion,\" says Niswanger, who points to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15404098/cannonball-adderley\">Cannonball Adderley</a>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15294441/herbie-hancock\">Herbie Hancock</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15368370/miles-davis\">Miles Davis</a> as models of artists who have moved easily among musical styles. \"Maybe it's more prone for festival-type vibes and outdoor, standing venues â€” dance, get up and move.\"</p><p>Niswanger says she sees an opening among her generation for jazz in the way it crosses genre boundaries.</p><p>\"I think jazz is starting to break into other areas,\" she says. \"I know that this big hip-hop album that just came out, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/166009689/kendrick-lamar\">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s <em><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/03/18/393838211/to-pimp-a-butterfly-aspires-to-be-musics-great-american-novel\">To Pimp A Butterfly</a></em>, there's jazz all over the album.
