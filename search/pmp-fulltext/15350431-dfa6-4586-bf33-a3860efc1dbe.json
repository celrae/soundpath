During the NBA Summer League, she became the NBA's first-ever female assistant coach.","itags":["npr_api","337359843"],"guid":"15350431-dfa6-4586-bf33-a3860efc1dbe","contentencoded":"<p>The NBA is made up of 30 teams, so there are 30 head coaches in the league — and right now, all of them are men. But Natalie Nakase hopes to change that.</p><p>Nakase is the assistant video coordinator for the Los Angeles Clippers, but her sights are set on the Clippers' bench — a goal she revealed to her co-workers.</p><p>\"I mentioned to some of the coaches ... that my goal eventually is to be a head coach in the NBA,\" Nakase tells NPR's Eric Westervelt.</p><p>Then Doc Rivers, the head coach of the Clippers, called Nakase into his office. She thought she was in trouble.</p><p>Instead, she was getting a job offer.</p><p>\"He just pulled me in and he said, 'Would you want to coach summer league?' ... My first response was shock,\" she says. \"And then I said yes right away.\"</p><p>It may not be the NBA's regular season, but coaching the summer league is a huge deal: Nakase is the first female assistant coach in NBA history.</p><p>The 5-foot-2 UCLA grad says she isn't intimidated by the Clippers players who tower above her,<strong> </strong>though the height difference does have a logistical implication.</p><p>\"When they sit down is probably the best time where I can really get into their ear because they're sitting and they're level to me,\" she says. \"If I say the right things, and things that can help them, then they'll listen, no matter how tall I am or if I'm a female.\"</p><p>Nakase is comfortable on the court. She was a starter for the UCLA Bruins women's basketball team and she became the first Asian-American to play in the National Women's Basketball League, or NWBL. But becoming a coach was never part of the plan.</p><p>\"I always told myself that I wanted to just keep playing because that's the best job, I think, in the world ... to play basketball and get paid for it,\" she says.</p><p>But after a serious knee injury ended her playing career, Nakase took on a different role. In 2011, she was appointed head coach of the Saitama Broncos in Japan, making her the first female head coach in Japanese men's professional basketball.</p><p>During the NBA's regular season, Nakase will continue working as assistant video coordinator for the Clippers. But if she's called down to the court, she says she'll be ready.</p><p>\"Whatever Doc [Rivers] needs, I'm going to do. ... If he wants to put me in a different situation on the bench or on the floor, then I'm just going to be prepared to do it,\" she says.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
