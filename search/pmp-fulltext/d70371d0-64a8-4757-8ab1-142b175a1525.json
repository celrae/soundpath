Two women and their podcast are on a mission to find out.","contentencoded":"<p>Less than two weeks after the Charlie Hebdo attacks — and the subsequent demands that followed for Muslims to denounce violence — it's got to be a tough time to produce a light-hearted podcast called \"<a href=\"http://www.goodmuslimbadmuslim.com/tazandzahra/\">Good Muslim/Bad Muslim</a>.\" But that's not what hosts Taz Ahmed and Zahra Noorbakhsh think.</p>\n<p>The two women argue it's actually a great time to show the lighter side of the Muslim community. And it's not like non-Muslims are short of questions.</p>\n<p>\"When people hear I drink and eat pork but still call myself Muslim, they saw me as someone who is quote un-quote 'assimilated' and referred to me as a 'good Muslim,'\" Noorbakhsh says. \"I thought that was hilarious, because both those things make me technically a 'bad Muslim.'\"</p>\n<p>Noorbakhsh's definitions of a \"good\" Muslim is pretty standard: someone who prays five times a day, fasts and observes Muslim holidays instead of discovering them through Twitter hashtags.</p>\n<p>It wasn't that clear for Ahmed. She never drank or got involved with drugs as a kid, but she loved going to punk shows. \"In my parents' eyes, that made me a terrible Muslim daughter,\" she says, \"and I think that's kind of the contradiction: All my friends considered me the good kid in school and at home I was considered the bad kid.\"</p>\n<p>The two women play up that ridiculousness in their podcast. For instance, Noorbakhsh's husband is an atheist, but he doesn't drink or eat meat “In a lot of ways, he’s more Muslim than I am,” Noorbakhsh says.</p>\n<p>The other big goal for the podcast is to challenge American ideas about Muslim women. Ahmed and Noorbakhsh hope to create some positive change in the Muslim community — or at least provide space for a community that didn't exist when they were in their teens.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been having these conversations on our own,” Ahmed. says “Others who are around us just laugh along with us, and we're hoping we can bring a lot more people along with us.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-01-15/you-cant-draw-muhammad-unless-youre-one-many-muslim-artists-who-did\">RELATED: You can't draw Muhammad, unless you're one of the thousands of Muslim artists who did </a></h2>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/GoodMuslimBadMuslim_front.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/goodmuslimbadmuslimfrontjpg"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/011920152.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/011920152mp3"}]}
