But there are a growing numbers of cities that have created affordable housing specifically for gay and lesbian seniors.</p><p><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org\"><em>Here & Now&#8217;</em></a>s Peter O&#8217;Dowd speaks to <strong>Kathleen Sullivan</strong>, the director of senior services at the <a href=\"http://www.lalgbtcenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Los Angeles LGBT Center</a> about the housing problem.</p><p>&#8220;Part of the problem that LGBT seniors have, is that when they go into a traditional assisted living community or a retirement community, often times they feel like they have to go back in the closet,&#8221; Sullivan explains. &#8220;They&#8217;re not able to talk about their life, their life partners, and that causes an enormous amount of stress.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Alice Herman </strong>lives in the oldest affordable housing complex for LGBT seniors, Hollywood&#8217;s <a href=\"http://gleh.org/about-us/our-buildings/triangle-square-hollywood\" target=\"_blank\">Triangle Square</a>. She echoes Sullivan&#8217;s characterization.</p><p>If Herman had lived in a traditional retirement community, she says she wouldn&#8217;t have talked about her partner of 47 years, Sylvia, who died right before Herman moved into Triangle Square.</p><p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have spoken about it because there&#8217;d be no one around me who would look at me and understand,&#8221; Herman explains. &#8220;We can tell our stories, but it&#8217;s one thing to tell your story to someone who looks at you with eyes that understand and to someone who just looks at you. Where I am at, people understand what I&#8217;m saying.&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s not that everyone at Triangle Square identifies as LGBT &#8212; in fact, Sullivan and Herman both insist that straight seniors do live there, and that it&#8217;s valuable to the community.</p><p>Herman says the community at Triangle Square &#8220;keeps her alive.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m starting my 80th year; I don&#8217;t have a lot of future ahead of me, I have a lot of past, I have a lot of history, and my history is Silvia,&#8221; Herman said. &#8220;I thought I was getting an affordable place where I&#8217;d be safe and I could have the cats. I got a thousand times more.&#8221;</p><ul><li><strong>WBUR&#8217;s CommonHealth:</strong> <a href=\"http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/01/lgbt-seniors-age-alone\" target=\"_blank\">Out, Proud And Old: LGBT Seniors More Likely To Age Alone</a></li></ul><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><strong>Kathleen Sullivan</strong>, director of Senior Services  at the <a href=\"http://www.lalgbtcenter.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Los Angeles LGBT Center</a>.</li><li><strong>Alice Herman</strong>, resident at <a href=\"http://gleh.org/about-us/our-buildings/triangle-square-hollywood\" target=\"_blank\">Triangle Square</a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
