They&#8217;re cisterns made of concrete, and the one these men worked on was badly deteriorated, with cracks in the concrete above and below the ground.</p><p><strong>How Guzzlers Work</strong></p><p>Guzzlers collect rainwater as it falls on an outer concrete apron, which guides the water into the cistern below.</p><p>&#8220;When it rains, the water falls on the apron and it just runs down and fills that cistern. And then there&#8217;s like a 25 degree slope or ramp to the bottom of that cistern so that animals can go down through that opening and walk down to the water,&#8221; said <a href=\"http://qfsd.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Quail Forever</a> member <strong>David Preddy,</strong> &#8220;There&#8217;s no moving parts, so the simplicity is actually kind of exquisite.&#8221;</p><p>These men are quail hunters. They say they will never hunt near a guzzler, where animals are vulnerable, and they may never get to hunt on this particular parcel of land.</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;Nobody loves the wildlife more than the ethical hunter, and that&#8217;s why I do this.&#8221;<div class=\"pullquoteauth\">&ndash; David Preddy</div></p><p></div></p><p>So why did they do it?</p><p><strong>A Labor Of Love</strong></p><p>&#8220;Nobody loves the wildlife more than the ethical hunter, and that&#8217;s why I do this,&#8221; said Preddy, who called himself a conservationist &#8220;along the lines of Teddy Roosevelt.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;d call this fun, this is definitely work, but it&#8217;s an act of love is basically what it is.&#8221;</p><p>But Preddy and the rest of the group aren&#8217;t just making the repairs so they&#8217;ll have more animals to hunt.</p><p>&#8220;This water source benefits all wildlife, not just game animals, so the argument that it&#8217;s only here to help out the hunting community is actually false,&#8221; said <strong>Jason Price</strong>, an environmental scientist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p><p><strong>Controversy Surrounding Ethical Hunting</strong></p><p>There are some hunters who take advantage of the guzzlers, however, which attract animals and leave them completely exposed while they drink.</p><p>&#8220;Some of the people are self-identified as hunters, but they don&#8217;t meet the specifications that we use for hunters,&#8221; said <strong>Jack Brandford</strong>, chairman of Quail Forever San Diego. &#8220;They&#8217;ll come here and prop themselves on the guzzler, and everything that comes, they&#8217;ll take care of it. That&#8217;s unsporting, it&#8217;s counterproductive, and they&#8217;ll do it until there&#8217;s no more animals in the area.&#8221;</p><p>While some animal rights groups have been critical of hunters and their impact on the ecosystem, Brandford said it&#8217;s often the hunters who do the most to help.</p><p>&#8220;This small group of people has done more this last year than most of these national anti- organizations have done to preserve wildlife period,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;d almost rather see them die of thirst than have people like us go out and preserve or provide water sources.&#8221;</p><p>Brandford hasn&#8217;t hunted quail in over two years. But given the importance of the work he and Quail Forever are doing, that&#8217;s alright with him.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sensation of having accomplished something,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can nibble at different definitions, but it&#8217;s like putting something back, putting back more than you take out.&#8221;</p><h4>See more photos from Robin Young&#8217;s visit</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><strong>Jason Price</strong>, environmental scientist from the <a href=\"https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">California Department of Fish and Wildlife</a>.</li><li>Members of <a href=\"http://qfsd.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Quail Forever San Diego</a>, a habitat restoration and hunting group.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
