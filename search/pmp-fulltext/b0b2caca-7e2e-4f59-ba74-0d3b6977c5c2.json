I do remember the first time I ever played for him. It was really a little bit intimidating because he was such a king figure in the guitar world. My guitar was literally bouncing off my chest, but eventually, I would say the magic of working with Segovia was sit just a few inches away from him when he would demonstrate, to hear this gorgeous diamond-like beautiful sound that he was able to produce, and that became the model of what I wanted for my sound and my tone.”</p><p><strong>On how she decided to become a guitarist</strong></p><p>“It was really an overnight experience because up until 14, I was very involved in science, model rockets and building cloud chambers. My father used to say that you can’t launch your rockets until you put in an hour on the guitar. So that was how he bribed me to continue. Then I managed to put in an hour of practice and win a competition, and the award was to perform for 10,000 people as a soloist with the Minnesota Orchestra. I remember stepping out onto the stage and thinking, you know, this is even more fun than watching my worms and grasshoppers go into space and I’m going to become a guitarist.”</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjROsUG6xoE\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Songs Heard In This Segment</h4><p><em>All songs performed by Sharon Isbin</em></p><ul><li>John Duarte, &#8220;Darling Cora&#8221;</li><li>Antonio Lauro, &#8220;Natalia&#8221; (performed live at <em>Here & Now</em>)</li><li>Tan Dun, &#8220;Concerto for Guitar and Orchestra (Yi2)&#8221;</li><li>Isaias Savio, &#8220;Batucada&#8221; (performed live at <em>Here & Now</em>)</li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.sharonisbin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sharon Isbin</a></strong>, classical guitarist.
