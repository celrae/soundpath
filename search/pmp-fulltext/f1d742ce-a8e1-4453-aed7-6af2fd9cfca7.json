The intrinsic value of a corporation can be estimated by the dividend yield when you purchase the stock and the subsequent earnings growth. It is corporate America that creates value; the stock market itself creates none. In fact, the stock market subtracts value, due to all the costs we pay to play the game. It’s a little bit like the casino, one might say. And I say that advisedly.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"Bloomberg Dark Pools\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-12/off-exchange-stock-trading-reaches-two-year-high-in-u-s-.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Bloomberg</strong>: Dark Pools Take Larger Share of Trades Amid SEC Scrutiny</a> &#8211; &#8221;Shares changing hands in private venues such as dark pools accounted for 40.4 percent of total share volume on June 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
