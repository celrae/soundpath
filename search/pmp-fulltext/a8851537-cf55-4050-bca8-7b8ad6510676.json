If approved, the ban would be the most restrictive in the nation. Flame retardants are found in couches, mattresses and some baby products.</p><p>Firefighters say the chemicals are toxic and wanted 10 chemicals included in the proposed ban. The chemical industry and state chamber of commerce opposed the ban. A compromise proposal limits the number of flame retardants from 10 to four.</p><p>The Minnesota House is expected to vote this Friday on the initiative. The Senate passed a previous version of the bill and is expected to approve a House version.
