You can review <a href=\"#footage\">footage</a> from Sean Smith of the Guardian, who embedded with them for a month. And when reviewing that footage, as a former infantryman, I looked at the way those soldiers were conducting operations, and I was stunned with the lack of professionalism.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve got soldiers who have come back from a pretty hellish deployment, had to shut up about it for five years, and now, the bubble&#8217;s burst and they can finally talk about it, and they&#8217;re directing a lot of the anger that is natural for any soldier to feel after a war directly at Bergdahl, which I think is unfair.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On allegations that soldiers died looking for Bergdahl</strong></p><p>&#8220;Applying any direct causal relationship &#8212; you know, Bowe Bergdahl and those soldiers dying &#8212; and I have the greatest sympathy for those families and those soldiers. I have a brother who was killed serving his country. I know how horrible that feels. But, you know, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to lay that directly at Bergdahl&#8217;s feet, and the fact is, it&#8217;s a bad area. Any time that you flood that zone with soldiers, there are going to be fatalities. So I think it&#8217;s kind of a weak link, and it&#8217;s an emotional argument that resonates with people, but isn&#8217;t necessarily factual.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the &#8220;PR campaign&#8221; surrounding Bergdahl&#8217;s release</strong></p><p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s fairly interesting and somewhat disgusting how politicized this has been.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;The political game being, you know, playing typical Washington games of using U.S. soldiers as pawns and props to make a political argument. Also, Bob and Jani Bergdahl, the parents of Bowe, are lovely people, they are good Americans, and they have been through hell in the past five years,<a name=\"footage\"></a> and I think the amount of disrespect they&#8217;ve been getting from all sides has been absolutely disgusting.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43v-1sYNTQg\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.mattbfarwell.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Farwell</a></strong>, a former infantry soldier in Afghanistan.
