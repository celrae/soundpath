They may be incredibly talented with creative ideas of their own — and, for the most part, you may never know.</p><p>Now, though, one of those background musicians — pianist <a href=\"https://chrisjoyner1.bandcamp.com/\">Chris Joyner</a> — is stepping center stage with an album of his own, the New Orleans-inspired <em>Domino</em>.</p><p>In his life as a sideman, Joyner played with everyone from Natalie Merchant of 10,000 Maniacs to Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine.</p><p>Joyner told NPR's Karen Grigsby Bates: \"I'd always been writing songs, keeping them to myself. I had a pretty pivotal moment in 2002: My sister's son passed away. And all of the things that I was taking too seriously and the fears that I had — I just let go. And, I figured, what have I got to lose?\"</p><p>On the album, he dedicates a song to his sister — the track called \"Hold and Keep.\"</p><p>\"She had some rough relationships,\" he says, \"and she had just been dealt a pretty rough hand. ... Love had always eluded her, it seemed like. I never felt as though she ever had a break. So this was was just: When you're going through Hell, keep going.\"</p><p>To hear Joyner talk more about his new album, take a listen at the audio link above.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
