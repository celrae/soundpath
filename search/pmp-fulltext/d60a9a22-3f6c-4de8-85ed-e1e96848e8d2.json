The irony is that we got into “Chet Baker Sings’” the record thinking that he was a singer.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Grant Widmer:</strong> Right.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Ted Joyner:</strong> Which he is.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Grant Widmer:</strong> You know, among jazz fans he’s probably more famous as a trumpet player.</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/SxmSY_fA-fA\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Ted Joyner:</strong> Well that’s the thing.

And so I hear ‘Rent Money” kind of being our appetizer, like when we first start bringing out the food.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Grant Widmer:</strong> Yeah, we’re gonna bring out some fried green tomatoes.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Ted Joyner:</strong> Oh yeah, there you go. Fried green tomatoes.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Grant Widmer:</strong> It’s a favorite appetizer dish for me and for folks around here.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Ted Joyner:</strong> You dip it in like a remoulade.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Grant Widmer:</strong> Yeah.

They’re kind of playing against type, and it has more of a breezy sort of like California maybe rock band vibe. I think sometimes it’s fun to have music that contradicts itself.</p>\n<br />\n<p>They’re kind of clean electric guitar sounds is sort of uplifting sounding, and then the song is about the kind of the day to day that this guy is going through.</p>\n<br />\n<h3>3. “Headache” by Frank Black</h3>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Ted Joyner:</strong> The third song that we’re gonna go into here is called “Headache” by Frank Black. As a 12-year-old I was kind of blown around by it, had no idea who The Pixies were or anything like that.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Grant Widmer:</strong> It’s a good kind of upbeat rocker, that’s why we chose it for our main course.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Ted Joyner:</strong> You realize you’re kind of nodding along to this song where Frank Black is telling you about his terrible affliction that he’s dealing with.</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/t2zb_iZC6nI\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Grant Widmer:</strong> I guess that’s kind of part of our menu is bad thought, bad feelings kept in like good vibes, good sounding vibes.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Ted Joyner:</strong> I think those are the best sounding songs. I guess it might turn a few friends off, and maybe they’ll push their plate away.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Grant Widmer:</strong> No, they’ll love it.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Ted Joyner:</strong> They’ll play along.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Grant Widmer:</strong> Yeah, so that’s all our songs for our dinner party, and I guess we’ll close it out with one of our own songs. This is a track off the new record that just came out.
