Soon drugs moved in. Upstanding residents moved out. And life got tougher. “We were just like, oh, they’re hanging out on the corners now,” says Smith. “All of a sudden, you just see the rise of violence in the community. And people just could not walk up and down the streets because they’d get shot.”\n<p>Smith moved out of the projects, went to college in Tennessee and eventually ended up in Marquette Park on the Southwest Side -- just in time to greet an influx of residents relocated from demolished housing projects all over the city, many with competing gang affiliations.</p>\n<p>“For example, you may&nbsp; have been Cabrini Green, that’s one gang,” says Smith. “And then you have the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Horner_Homes\">Horners</a>, who are another. And you put them all in one community area. Then you have war.”</p>\n<p>Such violence has now found its way to Smith’s current neighborhood. Yellow police tape near a blood spot on the pavement marks the area where a 17-year-old boy was shot five times -- just blocks away from Jamika Smith's house.</p>\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"122541\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":414,\"width\":600,\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"media-element\"}}]]</p>\n<p><em>Blood stains the pavement where a 17-year-old was shot</em></p>\nChicago is in fact something of a war zone today. <a href=\"https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/2012-Chicago-Murder-Statistics/ws3w-ba2s\">More people were killed in the city last year</a> than <a href=\"http://icasualties.org/OEF/ByYear.aspx\">U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan</a>. But did tearing down the projects cause the recent explosion in violence?\n<p>“I think the good news is that after we tore the high rises down, we moved thousands of families into other areas of the city,” says <a href=\"http://www.thecha.org/pages/meet_our_new_ceo/122.php\">Charles Woodyard</a>, CEO of the Chicago Housing Authority, “and that crime was reduced&nbsp;I think <a href=\"http://www.thecha.org/filebin/pdf/mapDocs/4_14_11_Report_FINAL_appendices.pdf\">as much as 60 percent at transformation sites</a>.”</p>\n<p>By transformation sites, Woodyard means places where the high-rises once stood. And he says that crime didn’t go up in most of the neighborhoods where former project residents moved. “There were a handful of exceptions, though,” Woodyard says, “and it’s all about concentration. What I mean by that is the number of these relocated households compared to the number of households in the neighborhood that they live in.”</p>\n<p>Put another way: If too many people from the projects ended up in one neighborhood, there was trouble. But <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/bio/SusanJPopkin.html\">Susan Popkin of the Urban Institute</a> warns against oversimplifying the violence problem in neighborhoods where former project residents now use rent vouchers. “The Section 8 [voucher] holders tend to move to places where rents are low already and crime is already high,” Popkin says.</p>\n<p>They went from poor, violent high-rises to poor, violent neighborhoods that already had problems. That did have some effect on the crime rate, she says. Violence was down in 2010, but it would have <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/publications/901492.html\">been down even more&nbsp;in certain neighborhoods</a> if not for the arrival of former project residents. “So I’m not saying there was no effect at all.
