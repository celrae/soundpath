But he goes back to Turkey every chance he gets, and on his latest trip last month, he noticed some major changes.</p><p>What struck him the most was the combination of Syrian refugees and Arab tourists flocking into Turkey. <span style=\"line-height: 1.538em;\">This was something new, certainly nothing like the tourists he saw before he left 21 years ago.</span></p><p>Back then, most of the visitors were from Western nations. There was certainly no flood of refugees fleeing a war just across the border. But even then, there were cultural and social divides in the country:&nbsp;rural vs. urban, elite vs. poor.</p><p>Not even music was exempt. For example, one of the most &quot;hotly debated topics was this &#39;Arabesque&#39; music movement. The so-called white Turks were really annoyed&quot; by this music, Sanlikol remembers.</p><p>You might think&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.turkishmusicclub.com/arabesque.htm\">Turkish Arabesque</a> is a nod to the Arab world, but, as Sanlikol explains, it&#39;s much more than that.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s actually a true blend of many Anatolian internal Turkish cultures,&quot; he says. That includes influences from different backgrounds you might find in the Turkish countryside, including &quot;Turkish, Kurdish, etc. So it really is, in fact, a rich ... type of social phenomenon.&quot; He likens the fusion to the racially mixed roots of rock-and-roll in the US.</p><p>On his latest CD, called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Whatsnext-Mehmet-Ali-Sanl-kol/dp/B00IL93KSG/ref=sr_1_1?s=dmusic&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412185436&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Mehmet+Ali+Sanl%3Fkol\">Whatsnext</a>, Sanlikol uses Turkish Arabesque melodies, but he&#39;s <a href=\"http://sanlikol.com/\">also a jazz musician</a>. So, on this album he merges both east and west.</p><p>This blending of two worlds is most evident in the song &quot;Palindrome.&quot;</p><p>[[{\"fid\":\"74737\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"height\":360,\"width\":480,\"alt\":\"Palindrome on YouTube\",\"title\":\"Palindrome\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"}}]]</p>","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/Turkish.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/turkishjpg"}]}
