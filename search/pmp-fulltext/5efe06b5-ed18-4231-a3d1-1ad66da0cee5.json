The other five officers face charges of involuntary manslaughter, assault and illegal arrest.</p><p>Mosby says the switchblade that officers said Gray had illegally carried clipped inside his pants was in fact a knife that was legal for him to carry, and that there was no justification for his arrest.</p><p>The announcement came after nearly two weeks of growing anger over Gray&#8217;s death.</p><p>And it came as the city braced for two more waves of protests today and tomorrow. The city is still under a nighttime curfew that took effect the day after the rioting that followed Gray&#8217;s funeral on Monday.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/people/4127076/jeff-brady\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Jeff Brady</strong></a>, national desk correspondent for NPR.
