The Puerto Rican rocker is one of the most enjoyable musicians we've ever had record a Guest DJ set for us. I can't think of another guest who's made me laugh so hard I had to turn away from the mic — but it didn't hurt that he's the one guest to bring beer along with an excellent selection of new Puerto Rican music.</p><p>Also joining us this week is the talented Ahmed Albizu, who plays bass with Davila and has his own terrific band, called Re-Animadores.</p><p>On second thought, maybe having AJ Davila on our show should be reserved for special occasions, kind of like Christmas. Davila Day is a respected holiday here at <em>Alt.Latino</em> — one we observe with laughter, beer and, of course, killer music.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
