That song's airy vocals and restrained instrumentation pair well with a pick from Robin: Dylan Shearer, who channels the folky, quiet side of Pink Floyd on a song called \"Meadow Mines (Fort Polio).\"</p><p>Also on the program: The strangely alluring electronica of London's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/search/index.php?searchinput=metronomy\">Metronomy</a>; and Robin mourns the loss his beloved Jayhawks suffered over the weekend in the NCAA basketball tournament with the soothing sounds of A Winged Victory For The Sullen.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
