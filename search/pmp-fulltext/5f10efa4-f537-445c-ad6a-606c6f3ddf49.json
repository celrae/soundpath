Half of Americans don&#8217;t get the recommended 8 hours of sleep, and 70 percent of teenagers don&#8217;t get the 9.25 hours they need.</p><p>But the lack of sleep is more than a nuisance. According to a new documentary by National Geographic, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health and the Public Good Projects, our sleepiness is killing us.</p><p>The documentary blames lack of sleep for some cases of diabetes, mental illness, cancers and Alzheimers.

Thus, doctors have told him you should &#8220;<strong>stay in bed as little as possible</strong>,&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>get up at the same time every day no matter how little sleep you&#8217;ve gotten, no matter how physically active you might have been the day before</strong>.&#8221; If you always start your day at the same time, &#8220;your body gets used to how much sleep pressure has built,&#8221; Hoffman says.</li><li>For those who wake up in the middle of the night, Hoffman recommends that you &#8220;<strong>get up out of bed, go into a dimly lit room, and do something boring</strong> &#8212; read a really bad piece of non-fiction, do a really hard crossword puzzle that you can&#8217;t possibly get through, and when you feel that need to sleep start building again, you start yawning a bit, go back to bed.&#8221;</li><li><strong>Don&#8217;t try to make up for missed weekday sleep on the weekends</strong>; &#8220;The damage is done,&#8221; Hoffman says.</li><li>&#8220;I struggle with not getting 8 hours of sleep,&#8221; Hoffman admits. &#8220;The vast majority of us, meaning people who don&#8217;t have insomnia and people who are not working two or three jobs to pay the bills, that majority is choosing to not get adequate sleep. They&#8217;re binge-watching television, they&#8217;re doing social media, they are choosing those things and all that stimulation over sleep. You know what? <strong>Put the devices away. Turn all those blue light-emitting devices off one hour before sleep time. And choose a bedtime that&#8217;s one hour earlier.</strong>&#8220;</li></ol><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qlxKFEE7Ec\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0388968/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>John Hoffman</strong></a>, executive producer of &#8220;Sleepless in America.&#8221;</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
