Their thesis draws on anthropology, archeology, primatology, anatomy and psychosexuality.</p><p>As a psychologist, Ryan's research focuses on trying to distinguish the human from the cultural. His book, he hopes, is \"pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love, cooperation and generosity.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
