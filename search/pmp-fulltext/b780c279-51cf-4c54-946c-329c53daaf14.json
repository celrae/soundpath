This eight-voice ensemble, which includes the 2013 Pulitzer Prize-winning composer <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2013/04/20/177962358/a-moment-with-pulitzer-winning-composer-caroline-shaw\" target=\"_blank\">Caroline Shaw</a>, is gleefully dismantling the traditional definition of ensemble singing right before our ears (and teeth!).</p><p>Musical descendants of the innovative <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipTwEKsM94A\" target=\"_blank\">extended vocal techniques</a> of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/89532661/meredith-monk\" target=\"_blank\">Meredith Monk</a>, the Teeth tend to make sounds — some sweet, others alarming — that you probably haven't heard from a group of humans.</p><p>In Australian composer Wally Gunn's \"The Fence is Gone,\" verses emerge from an infrastructure of \"oh-ha\" syllables and a simple drum pulse, ending with women's voices, tight in harmony, like a chord from a Casio keyboard. In Rinde Eckert's \"Cesca's View,\" imagine a lonely cowgirl on some windswept plain. Estelí Gomez gets her yodel on, beautifully, while the three other women vocalize in close, barbershop-style harmony. It literally ends on a high note.</p><p>To finish, Teeth founder and director Brad Wells contributes \"Otherwise.\" Warm, rounded tones in male voices contrast with a steely sheen from the women and a high drone like a Tibetan singing bowl. The harmonies take a tangy, almost Bulgarian turn, then we get something truly otherworldly. A pulsing, slightly creepy Sardinian \"bim-bom\" vocalise buzzes like a gigantic cicada. Dashon Burton's operatic baritone soars above it all. The agility of the voices and multicolored blend they achieve are extraordinary.</p><p>As the applause faded away, one of the Teeth said, \"Thanks for letting us yell at you.\" No, I think it's we who are grateful — and perhaps a little stunned.</p><p>Set List:</p><ul><li>Wally Gunn: \"The Fence Is Gone\"</li><li>Rinde Eckert: \"Cesca's View\"</li><li>Brad Wells: \"Otherwise\"</li></ul><h5>Roomful of Teeth:</h5><p>Martha Cluver, soprano</p><p>Estelí Gomez, soprano</p><p>Virginia Warnken, mezzo-soprano</p><p>Caroline Shaw, alto</p><p>Eric Dudley, tenor</p><p>Avery Griffin, baritone</p><p>Dashon Burton, bass-baritone</p><p>Cameron Beauchamp, bass</p><p>Brad Wells, director</p><h5>Credits:</h5><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Tom Huizenga, Maggie Starbard; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; Videographers: Colin Marshall, Maggie Starbard, Susan Hale Thomas; Assistant Producer: Susannah Whittle </em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
