A 27-year-old medical student in Cleveland was following health insurance very closely – she’s concerned about access to care and wants a single-payer system, even though it would mean less money for her.&#8221;</p><p>But the most politically-minded person Rohr says she has spoken with so far was Jordan Bridges, a 26-year-old coal miner in Logan, West Virginia.</p><p>&#8220;He opposes environmental regulations that are hurting the coal industry,&#8221; Rohr said. &#8220;He says he’s seen many layoffs as a result, and in fact his own company is planning layoffs at the end of this month – that he and his young family are bracing for.&#8221;</p><p>On the lighter side, Rohr has also seen a variety of regional culture.</p><p>&#8220;The other night, in Louisville I went to the Episcopal Church of the Advent, because I got a tip about Louisville’s contra dance scene – contra dance is traditional partnered folk dancing,&#8221; Rohr said. &#8220;There were people of all ages there and in particular, people in their early 20s.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/about/people/rachel-rohr\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rachel Rohr</strong></a>, social media and web producer for Here & Now, and host of the podcast &#8220;Alternate Routes.&#8221; She tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LionTalk\" target=\"_blank\">@LionTalk.</a></li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
