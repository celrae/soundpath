None of the musicians featured in this episode have ever been played on <em>All Songs</em> before â€” we set out to find artists aiming for different musical targets than we're used to. We found a piercing look at anxiety in the face of romantic revelation, an R&B/dance hybrid that spans more genres than it does minutes, an unflappable retort to unforgivable behavior and a song that sounds like the soundtrack to an '80s prom ... for ghosts. Nobody else is doing what these six artists are doing, and we can't wait to see where each of them goes from here.</p><p><em>LANGUAGE ADVISORY: Some of the songs included in this episode include profanity.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
