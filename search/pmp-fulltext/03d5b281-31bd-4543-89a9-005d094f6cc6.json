He was a spare-parts trader in his native Nnewi. He turned his brother's spare-parts side business into his own import venture. As the prices of motorcycles coming in from Japan increased in the 1980s, he noticed something about the way they were shipped. They were coming in by barge in containers. Being a spare-parts trader, he recognized that a motorcycle is made up of individual parts. And so, he thought, if he imported motorcycles in pieces, they would take up a lot less space in the shipping container. And he was right. At the time importers were shipping about 40 pre-assembled motorcycles in a single shipping container. But as individual parts, Innocent could fit more than 200 motorcycles in each container. Innocent now had a significant advantage over his competitors; he could sell his motorcycles for much less.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Another advantage he had over his competitors was the cost of labor in Nigeria. A factory worker in Nigeria would earn around $500 a month.&nbsp;<span>He explains, \"when I brought the first one I called the local people, and gave them small training, they assembled it perfectly and the price was cheaper.\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Much cheaper in fact, \"When they are selling for about 150,000 [naira] for one motorcycle I sold my own for 80,000.\"</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span>Innocent</span>'s bikes were nearly half the price of his competitors. He sold three containers worth of motorcycles in about three months.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">\"So I went back and brought about 10 containers, and the 10 containers took me about one month to finish.\"</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">By the time he had the process down he was buying 200 containers.&nbsp;<span>But&nbsp;<span>Innocent</span><span>'s&nbsp;</span>advantage didn’t last forever, soon everyone was copying his strategy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">\"Back then the price crashed to 60,000 but when I saw that the price had come down and then everybody was doing it. That’s why I build this plastic plant.\"</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Motorcycles were just the beginning for Innocent. He had another realization, that he could manufacture some of the motorcycle parts himself. Specifically the plastic parts.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span>Innocent</span>&nbsp;now makes all kinds of products. His motorcycle business has expanded to cars and buses. His plastics plants now manufacture tables, chairs, water drums, plates, boxes for electricity meters, and much more. And he believes anyone can follow his lead in Africa, which he refers to as virgin territory for entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><span><span>Innocent</span>'s</span>&nbsp;optimism is infectious. It's easy to get swept up in the euphoria of success. But business in Nigeria is not easy.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Back in Onitsha market it's also a microcosm of the obstacles entrepreneurs face every day.&nbsp;<span>The day I was there the traders were protesting against a new levy. The trade association decided to charge for a video security system, which the traders said the state governor had given them for free. It’s the sort of surprise cost that wrecks a business plan.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">But corruption is not even the biggest problem in Nigeria. Other countries have thrived despite corruption, and Nigeria shouldn't be different.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The lights go out constantly, and nobody bats an eye or feigns surprise. Everyone just carries on. Nigeria may be Africa’s biggest oil exporter. But according to one estimate it generates only enough electricity to power a single toaster for every 44 people.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">People make do with diesel generators. Which are costly. And that even applies to big factories.&nbsp;<span>Innocent</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;showed me his electricity bill for the plastics plant, 40 million naira a month, \"I spend 60 million on diesel every month.\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">He also proudly showed off his collection of second-hand generators, which he said were built stronger in the past than now.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">For <span>Innocent,</span><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;the high cost of energy is a necessary part of doing business in Nigeria. But it puts a real brake on what entrepreneurs can achieve.&nbsp;<span>A recent privatization of the national power company offers hope for the future. But for now it takes the shine off Nigeria as a place to do business.</span></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The people I met are not put off by these obstacles.
