The most obvious is size. The paper's losing three inches of width to save around $18 million in newsprint costs. But as Alisa Roth reports, that's not all.<br />\n<br />\n<hr />\n<br />\n<strong>ALISA ROTH:</strong> The smaller format will mean about 10 percent less space for print stories, though that shift will be offset by putting some tables on the Web.<br />\n<br />\nThe new print edition will focus more on analysis and exclusive stories. It'll leave breaking news to the web, where it can be updated frequently.<br />\n<br />\nJournalism professor Phil Meyer is author of the book, \"The Vanishing Newspaper, Saving Journalism in the Information Age.\"\n<blockquote><strong>PHIL MEYER:</strong> Newspapers have to figure out how to use the Web. Putting the analysis in print so you can read it at you leisure and having the fast-breaking stuff on the Web makes sense to me.</blockquote>\nNewspapers are also trying to find ways to stay profitable. Meyer says the Journal's redesign seems like a good start.\n<blockquote><strong>MEYER:</strong> Nobody knows the smart way to do it, so it's important to try lots of different things.</blockquote>\nAnd the changes mean readers can save a little money, too. Both the print and online editions will be free tomorrow.<br />\n<br />\nIn New York, I'm Alisa Roth for Marketplace.<br />\n<br /></div>","teaser":"The daily diary of business is taking three inches of width off its newspaper to save $18 million in newsprint costs.
