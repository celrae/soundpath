Its archive tracks the way music changes over time and across many productions.","itags":["npr_api","355165335"],"guid":"a4e18472-3143-4b2a-95de-0762632f95a8","contentencoded":"<p>For more than a century, the Royal Shakespeare Company in England has hired composers to write original music for its productions. That sheet music has sat in a vault for decades — until now.</p><p>The company has started releasing albums that combine music from its contemporary productions with much older works.</p><p>Bruce O'Neill, head of music for the Royal Shakespeare Company, describes the archive as \"a bit like a bank vault.\"</p><p>\"You've got these various rooms with, sort of, very thick doors with a big wheel on the front to let you in,\" O'Neill tells NPR's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/people/2101154/ari-shapiro\">Ari Shapiro</a>. \"And they're all sort of organized along these shelves and categorized by date and by composer in some instances. Although they're organized to a certain extent, some of them really haven't actually been looked through since the production happened.\"</p><p>The collection includes compositions from well-known composers. Twentieth-century composer <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/91650116/ralph-vaughan-williams\" target=\"_blank\">Ralph Vaughn Williams</a>' adaptation of \"Greensleeves\" for the 1913 production of <em>Richard II</em> is just one example.</p><p>\"That [piece] sort of demonstrates that, at that time, there was still a propensity to use existing pieces of music,\" O'Neill says of the adaptation. \"Vaughan Williams was obviously hugely interested in folk music. So he was arranging a lot of folk music.\"</p><p>The archive has served the company well over the years. For a contemporary production of <em>Richard II</em>, O'Neill only had to visit the vault to find inspiration.</p><p>\"We look back a hundred — <em>exactly</em> a hundred years — and there we had Ralph Vaughan Williams, <em>Music For Richard II </em>from 1913,\" O'Neill says. \"It was a beautiful start for us.\"</p><p>The albums too juxtapose the contemporary with older works. This year, composer Michael Bruce adapted <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/tags/158205949/william-shakespeare\" target=\"_blank\">Shakespeare</a>'s song \"Who Is Sylvia?\" into an indie-rock ballad for a production of <em>Two Gentlemen Of Verona</em>. Listeners can compare this version with one from 1938 by Anthony Bernard.</p><p>\"This is why I knew that we had to delve into the archive,\" O'Neill says. \"Because, in 1938, that was modern. And classics only become classics after a length of time. ... That's the beauty of it. And when people are listening to Michael Bruce's version in, say, a hundred years time, I wonder what they will think of that.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
