Allied and German forces engaged in pitched, chaotic skirmishes throughout the picturesque Norman countryside, marked by hedgerows and old stone-and-steeple towns.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"USA Today D Day Weather\" href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2014/06/03/d-day-weather-forecast/9914207/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>USA Today</strong>: D-Day: The most important weather forecast in history</a> &#8212; &#8220;It was 70 years ago this week that Gen. Eisenhower&#8217;s chief meteorologist, Group Capt. James Martin Stagg, made one of the most important weather forecasts of all time. Defying his colleagues, he advised Ike to postpone the invasion of Normandy by one day from June 5, 1944, to June 6, because of uncertain weather conditions.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"Boston Globe French D-Day\" href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/05/31/how-french-saw-day/U7JLZNtaUxTw4s5qaNKueO/story.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Boston Globe</strong>: How the French saw D-day</a> &#8212; &#8220;Until recently, Americans have largely ignored the experience of the liberated, the French civilians—in particular the Normans—during those first days and weeks. After four years under the Nazi occupation, the men, women, and children of Normandy welcomed their liberators. But their gratitude was often mingled with confusion and bitterness: On D-day, American firepower took 3,000 French civilian lives, as many as the Americans lost to German firepower at Omaha Beach. By the time Normandy was fully liberated, more than 20,000 civilians had died, most of them victims of the Allied bombings that pummeled the region’s cities and towns.&#8221;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
