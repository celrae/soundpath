Now a world-class saxophonist, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/98785675/rudresh-mahanthappa\" target=\"_blank\">Rudresh Mahanthappa</a> is paying homage to Parker with his new album, <em>Bird Calls</em>. Mahanthappa says it's a tribute to Charlie Parker — but there are no Charlie Parker songs here.</p><p>\"Each composition is <em></em><em>based</em> on a particular Charlie Parker song or solo,\" he explains. \"Really, I feel like the best way we can pay tribute is to show what we've learned from him — not so much play his music.\"</p><p>The idea for the record took root years ago, when Mahanthappa was working with a student on a Parker tune called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hANODMX9c5g\" target=\"_blank\">Donna Lee</a>\" — a notoriously fast and complicated piece that sax players often strive to master, the way a budding rock guitarist might study \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI7XiJgt0vY\" target=\"_blank\">Eruption</a>.\" To make the song more approachable, they broke it into smaller chunks.</p><p>\"But in hearing these snippets out of context, these snippets started sounding more like Bartok or contemporary classical music, or even elements of something more funk-like — just modern,\" Mahanthappa says. \"And it started striking me that maybe there was more to Charlie Parker than I had previously thought.\"</p><p>Mahanthappa spoke with NPR's Arun Rath about what he's learned from Parker, and why the late master's music always feels personal to him — even on paper.
