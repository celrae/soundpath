It also helped jazz cross over to a larger audience; quite a few flower children bought Impulse albums.</p><p>But over time, the new thing got old. Impulse went dormant for nearly a decade. When it was time for the label to come out of hibernation in 1986, New Orleans pianist <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/90187253/henry-butler\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Butler</a> sounded the wake-up call. In the 1990's Impulse went on hiatus a second time, and now, once again, Henry Butler has been called upon to help reboot the label.</p><p><em>Viper's Drag</em>, out this month, is Butler's collaboration with arranger and trumpeter <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15235981/steven-bernstein\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Bernstein</a>.
