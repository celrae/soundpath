And you can kind of just, like, listen to the song and nod your head with your mouth open like you’re paying attention to the person that you’re talking to, when you’re really not.</p>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br />\n<h2>Larry Jon Wilson – “Ohoopee River Bottomland”</h2>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/pJxvh16Ky_c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Bobby Martin:</strong> My choice would be Larry Jon Wilson.
