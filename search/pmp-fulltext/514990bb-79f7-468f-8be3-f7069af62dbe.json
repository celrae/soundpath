The Leonards recently sold their house to spend a few years with their three kids sailing around the world on a boat. “A 50-foot catamaran,” he said. “Four bedrooms with queen sized beds and everyone has their own bathroom.

Leonard acknowledges that he has a good life, and a certain amount of peace of mind. But he says that financial security has only come after years of insecurity and deep debt while he was building his business. “We haven’t saved what I wish we would have for our kids' college,” he said. “We’re not putting away the money that I would like us to for retirement.” Leonard says when it comes to that kind of long-term planning, he still feels “behind the eight-ball.”</p>\n<p>He says he feels less wealthy than a government worker who could retire at age 50 and expect a $40,000 pension each year.&nbsp; And he definitely feels less wealthy than the clients he works with as a wealth manager, who don’t work for a living and live off their investments.</p>\n<p>Wealth is relative, says Leonard, and in the world that he lives in, “you look around -- there's always someone who's got a better seat at the basketball game.
