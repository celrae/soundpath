Judge Ronald Adrine found probable cause to charge Officer Timothy Loehmann &#8211; who fired the shot &#8211; with murder, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide and dereliction of duty, and his partner Officer Frank Garmback with negligent homicide and dereliction of duty.</p><p>The judge&#8217;s ruling, however, is not binding. The county prosecutor is handling the case and pledged to give evidence to a grand jury to determine whether the officers should be charged. But <strong>Walter Madison</strong>, Rice&#8217;s family attorney, wants the prosecutor to bypass the grand jury and issue a warrant for the officers&#8217; arrest.
