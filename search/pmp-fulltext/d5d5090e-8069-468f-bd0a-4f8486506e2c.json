We’ll dig into the President’s plan and its implications for climate change and the economy.</p><p>If necessary, the President told the country, he would act on his own, without Congress, to protect the environment, the planet.  Yesterday, through the EPA, he did.  New proposed rules would cut American carbon emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030.  That means, basically, closing or retooling coal-fired power plants to cut pollution and climate change.  The cost?  That will now be debated.  The economic cost of acting.  The environmental cost of not acting.  The alternative energy sources that will move in.  This hour On Point:  the climate, the economy, and the Obama plan.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: right\"><strong>&#8211; Tom Ashbrook</strong></p><h4>Guests</h4><p><a title=\"Amy Harder\" href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/H/amy-harder/7954\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Amy Harder</strong></a>, energy policy reporter for The Wall Street Journal.

The carbon framework seeks to strike a balance between what environmentalists want—an ambitious overall target—with what the utility industry wants—flexibility, a long compliance timeline and an earlier base-year calculation from which to meet the goal. Carbon emissions have dropped since 2005, making the overall reduction smaller when compared with recent years.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"NYT Old Law New Tricks\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/opinion/teaching-an-old-law-new-tricks.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>New York Times</strong>: Teaching an Old Law New Tricks</a> &#8212; &#8220;Don’t expect big changes anytime soon.

With Congress paralyzed on the issue, the country’s climate and energy policy is being made in arcane legal battles over the meaning of single phrases in statutes written long ago, leaving government and industry to duke it out in court.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"Politico EPA Rules\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/reports-obama-to-seek-30-percent-cuts-in-power-plants-carbon-pollution-107301.html?hp=r2\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>POLITICO</strong>: Obama seeks 30 percent cuts in power plants&#8217; carbon pollutio</a>n &#8212; &#8220;The draft rule also supplied an instant campaign issue for Republicans, who are already pounding vulnerable Democratic candidates as accomplices in a job-destroying, Obama-led “war on coal.” Legal challenges from some states and industry groups are considered inevitable, but EPA has won a string of recent court victories that have boosted the agency’s confidence in its strategy.&#8221;</p><h4><a title=\"EPA Clean Power Plan\" href=\"http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-05/documents/20140602proposal-cleanpowerplan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Read The EPA&#8217;s Draft Clean Power Plan</a></h4>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
