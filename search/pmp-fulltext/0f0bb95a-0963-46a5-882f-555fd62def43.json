The question is:<br />\n<br />\n“When no radio is around, I love singing my own, personal a cappella renditions of Top 40 music.&nbsp;I often don’t know the actual words, and I’m too lazy to figure them out. My ad-libbed lyrics annoy my friend Ed. Am I doing a disservice to Ed, the musicians responsible for the song, and/or music in general?&nbsp; Or am I allowed to improvise as I see fit?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jon Wurster:</strong> I think you should improvise as you see fit.&nbsp; Because one of the greatest, funniest stories I have ever come across is related to this.</p>\n<br />\n<p>I used to work at a store called Record Bar. My first day of work – this is a side-story – I showed up and I was told one of the maintenance guys had been crushed in the elevator that morning. That was how I started.</p>\n<br />\n<p>So, anyway, one of the guys that worked there was named Rusty. And Rusty had a great story of a woman coming up to him, this would have been 1982 or 1983, and saying “I’m looking for that song about the cat.”</p>\n<br />\n<p>And he goes, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She says, “You know, that one about the cat!” And he goes, “Ma’am I really don’t know. Could you, like, sing some of it for me?”</p>\n<br />\n<p>And she goes: “Yeah, it goes…&nbsp;&nbsp;[Tune of \"Rock the Casbah\"] ‘Siamese-sies don’t like it!/Not the cat’s fault!/Not the cat’s fault!’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Did you just make that up?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jon Wurster:</strong> No! And Rusty said he had to just, like, walk backwards into the storeroom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> “I will not strike this dear woman.”</p>\n<br />\n<p>Did you answer the etiquette question? I don’t know.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jon Wurster:</strong> Oh, yeah. I think it’s fine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> You support Andrew from New York.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Sing whatever you want, whenever you want.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jon Wurster:</strong> Yes!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<h2>The Tastykake Menu</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Brian in Brighton, Mass asks:<br />\n<br />\n“When should I serve my guests their customary Tastykakes?”</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam:</strong> We think this is a reference to when you were on the show “The Best Show on WFMU.”&nbsp; And one of your characters on the show is Philly Boy Roy, and he liked all things Philadelphia: Hoagies, etc… and Tastykakes.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jon Wurster:</strong> Well, if <em>Roy</em> was answering the question, he would say, [affecting character voice] “Oh every course could be a Tastykake! You start off with the peanut-butter candy cake, that’s your salad. And then your entree is the coconut cream pie. And then, for dessert, the krimpet, the butterscotch krimpet. And then your coffee is the cream-filled cupcake.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Brendan Francis Newnam</strong>: Jon Wurster, everyone!</p>\n<br />\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/wqMYvr2wfVU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<br /></div>","published":"2014-08-21T05:49:06+00:00","audio":[{"meta":{"width":null,"height":null,"crop":"primary"},"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wurster.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Headshot-2.png","type":"image/png","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null}},{"meta":{"width":null,"crop":"primary","height":null},"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jane.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"meta":{"duration_hms":"00:08:42","api":{"href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm_audio:/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2014/08/22/0822_wurster","type":"application/json"},"duration":522},"type":"audio/mpeg","href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/dinnerpartydownload/segments/2014/08/22/0822_wurster_128.mp3","format":"MP3"}]}
