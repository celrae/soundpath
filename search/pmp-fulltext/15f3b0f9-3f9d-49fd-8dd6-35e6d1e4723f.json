Rents in Portland and many other cities have been rising fast as the economy improves and there's not enough inventory of homes for sale to take the pressure off. &nbsp;So, having locked in a 3.5 percent 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, Kirk and Abbie are saving about $400 per month now.</p>\n<p>But they acknowledge the financial risk of buying isn’t far from their minds.

Kirk continues: “We had both been laid off in 2009. But all that time we were sitting on a down payment.
