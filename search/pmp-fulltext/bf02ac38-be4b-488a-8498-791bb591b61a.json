I’d stay still it’s New York and London.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Theater is still part of the conversation [in London]. It’s something people go to with some regularity—or at least a certain tribe of people do. Here, going to a play is more of a special event.”</p><p><strong>On giving harsh criticism</strong></p><p>&#8220;All you can do is try to recreate the experience you had when you were sitting there and with as much of a visceral feeling as possible. If you’re disgusted, then register your disgust &#8212; you do try to remember there are real people and real jobs at stake as well.”</p><p><strong>On the best show on Broadway right now</strong></p><p>&#8221; &#8216;The Book of Mormon.&#8217; I saw that again recently, it holds up very well. It still feels fresh, it still feels insolent and respectful in just the right way. Because ultimately this show — for all its talk about being an iconoclastic show — is a celebration of musicals and why we go to them.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/ref/theater/BRANTLEY-BIO.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Ben Brantley</strong></a>, chief theater critic for the New York Times.
