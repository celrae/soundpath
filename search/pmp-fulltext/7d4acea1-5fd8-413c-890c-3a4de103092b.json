Are ratings really information for parents, or are they still judgments on the morality of your creation? Is there anywhere to go past what a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493459/\" target=\"_blank\">past documentary</a> already explored? Kat talks about being carded at the movies, Stephen compares film boyhood to real boyhood, and we hear from Julie Andrews on the topic of reason.</p><p>We do not talk this week about the new tornado movie <em>Into The Storm</em>, because we couldn't bring ourselves to see it, but we do take a moment to consider the disaster movie and, more specifically, the weather disaster movie. This leads us into a conversation about <em>Twister</em> so involved that our producer, Jessica Reedy, had an entire side conversation while we were taping and admitted later that she tuned back in and thought, \"Wow, still talking about <em>Twister</em>.\" (We try to make Jessica's job eternally surprising.)</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is all about being made happy by <a href=\"http://www.avam.org/\" target=\"_blank\">a museum</a> â€” but not just any museum. I'm happy about some of our PCHH projects as well as NPR's newest <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/about/products/npr-one/\" target=\"_blank\">way to listen</a>. (You can try it as a <a href=\"http://one.npr.org/\" target=\"_blank\">web app</a>, too.) Glen is happy about <a href=\"http://www.brothersthegame.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a game</a> that I can join him in recommending. And Kat is happy about a series she encourages you to enjoy so that you can drool over chefs and their creations.</p><p>Find us <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pchh\" target=\"_blank\">on Facebook</a> or follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nprmonkeysee\" target=\"_blank\">me</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/idislikestephen\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ghweldon\" target=\"_blank\">Glen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/katchow\" target=\"_blank\">Kat</a>, producer <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jessica_reedy\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica</a>, also-producer <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/lmigaki\" target=\"_blank\">Lauren</a>, and our dear pal <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/mikekatzif\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Katzif</a>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
