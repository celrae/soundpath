If they vote to leave the UK &mdash; and polls say it&#39;s looking better for the &quot;Yes&quot; cause &mdash; what will happen to the world-famous Union Jack?</p><p>The blue and white Scottish flag, the Saltire, would obviously take on new meaning. But it also forms part of&nbsp;United Kingdom&#39;s Union Jack, along with England&#39;s Cross of St. George and Northern Ireland&#39;s Saltire of St. Patrick.</p><p>[[{\"fid\":\"73662\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":263,\"width\":263,\"style\":\"font-size: 13.3333339691162px; line-height: 1.538em; width: 250px; height: 250px; margin: 5px; float: right;\",\"alt\":\"Scottish saltire of St. Andrew\",\"title\":\"Scottish saltire of St. Andrew\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"},\"link_text\":null}]]<span style=\"font-size: 13.3333339691162px; line-height: 1.538em;\">So do you just pull out the blue and white?</span></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that simple,&rdquo; says Graham Bartran, the chief vexillologist &mdash; that&#39;s another word for flag expert &mdash; at The Flag Institute in London. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be like saying to an American, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to take the red stripes out, so you&rsquo;d have a white flag with a blue corner and fifty stars on it.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d feel it was their flag anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Bartran says redesigning the flag opens up a veritable can of worms.&nbsp;&ldquo;As soon as you say you&rsquo;re going to change the flag, you have to start to listening to everyone who has their own ideas of what they want to change it to,&rdquo; he points out.</p><p>For example, the Welsh have complained for many years that they are not explicitly represented in the Union Jack. Wales is a principality of the United Kingdom and is technically represented by the English cross of St. George, but they don&rsquo;t have their own symbol on the flag.</p><p>[[{\"fid\":\"73663\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":1098,\"width\":1800,\"style\":\"width: 251px; height: 153px; margin: 5px; float: right;\",\"alt\":\"English cross of St. George\",\"title\":\"English cross of St. George\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"},\"link_text\":null}]]</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s the question of the Christian characteristics &mdash; all those crosses &mdash; that make up the flag. In a multicultural, diverse United Kingdom, how do you represent other British beliefs?</p><p>&ldquo;Do we have to have a star and crescent? A Star of David?&quot; Bartran asks. &ldquo;What has started off as a very simple design is becoming very, very complicated, very quickly.&rdquo;</p><p>Symbols on a flag can sometimes seem arbitrary as the modern world becomes an increasingly global place. But Bartran says those symbols still carry huge weight.</p><p>&ldquo;People need the anchor of identity and flags are a very important part of that identity,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>[[{\"fid\":\"73664\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":768,\"width\":1280,\"style\":\"width: 250px; height: 150px; margin: 5px; float: right;\",\"alt\":\"St. Patrick&#039;s cross of Northern Ireland\",\"title\":\"St. Patrick&#039;s cross of Northern Ireland\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\"},\"link_text\":null}]]</p><p>The other issue that Scottish independence would raise is the very name of the United Kingdom itself. No longer would there be two kingdoms &mdash; Scotland and England &mdash; united, so the United Kingdom wouldn&rsquo;t be as fitting a name. And the &quot;Former United Kingdom&rdquo; has some obvious acronym problems.</p><p>The moniker of &ldquo;Great Britain&quot; is also problematic, Bartran says. Great Britain refers to the largest British isle, which is made up in large part by Scotland.</p><p>Bartran has come up with his own name: Engwalni.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s the first few letters of the remaining parts of the United Kingdom: England, Wales and Northern Island.</p><p>Needless to say, the idea hasn&rsquo;t quite taken off. But it speaks to the complexity of the issue.</p><p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re taking a structure that is 400 years old &mdash; and is so embedded in everything we are &mdash; and trying to undo it,&quot; he says. &quot;It&rsquo;s a really complicated task.&quot;</p>","audio":[{"href":"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/unionjack1.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/unionjack1jpg"},{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTduy7Qkvk8"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/do-you-have-flag-eddie-izzard"}]}
