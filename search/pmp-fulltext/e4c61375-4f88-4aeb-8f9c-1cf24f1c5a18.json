The company’s sales are growing in portable speakers, licensed automobile-audio systems, and audio software, both in the U.S. and abroad.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of skeptics of the headphones’ quality, and price point. San Diego smartphone developer Jesse Ridgway, 24, tried his roommate’s Beats headphones back in college. He says he could certainly afford a pair himself, “but I just don’t think it’s the best use of money, because the sound quality of most audio is not good enough to the point where you’ll notice the difference.” He compares buying a pair of $200 or $300 headphones to “buying a big plasma-screen HDTV to play your VHS tapes.”</p>\n<p>To counteract that frugalista attitude, Beats is betting on the cachet of Dr. Dre and his music career. It worked for consumer Nathan Gallaway. He’s 26, works for a wireless carrier in Chicago and has just started an independent film company.</p>\n<p>“It actually is a great deal of money,” Gallaway admits, adding that “luckily my mother isn’t still looking over my purchases.” But he also thinks it's worth it. He relishes listening to his favorite music, Motown and rock and roll, on his Beats headphones, and says they reveal more layers of music than cheaper headphone brands he’s tried. &nbsp;He adds that he used to lose or damage his headphones frequently, but now that he has expensive ones, he takes better care of them.</p>\n<p>Finally, he says, while Dr. Dre’s celebrity didn’t attract him, the fashion statement he could make with the headphones did. “Not only did I like the sound quality, the colors drew me in as well. I wanted something to personalize my style.” &nbsp;He chose dark blue. “That really matched me,” he says.</p></div>","tags":["APM","Business","Carlyle Group","Mergers and Acquisitions","beats audio","studio beats"],"published":"2013-09-27T16:18:11+00:00","itags":["PMP:Marketplace_PMP","Marketplace","e4c613754f88aeb7f9c21cf24f1c5a18","Marketplace for Friday, September 27, 2013"],"teaser":"A private equity group  is investing in Dr. Dre’s Beats Electronics.
