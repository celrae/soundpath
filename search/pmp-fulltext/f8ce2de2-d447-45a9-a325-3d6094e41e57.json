Now they're releasing a new album, <em>Render.</em></p><p>Artistic director Brad Wells has emphasized that the group is a band, not a choir. That's something that's gotten him into trouble with a lot of his friends in the choral world, he says. Still, he holds firmly to the notion.</p><p>\"In a choral setting,\" Wells says, \"typically you have at the very least three or four altos, three or four tenors, and you're going for a rich, clean blend in each section. And this group is about not single colors or single unifying blends, but almost the opposite: juxtaposing the individual colors of the voices in the group.\"</p><p>The title of <em>Render</em> embodies that approach for founding member and Pulitzer Prize-winning composer <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2013/04/20/177962358/a-moment-with-pulitzer-winning-composer-caroline-shaw\" target=\"_blank\">Caroline Shaw</a>.</p><p>\"For me, it's the idea of seeing distinct particles slowly come together and create an image â€” that's what video rendering is,\" she says. \"And I think our next journey through this second album, and beyond, is to see how our distinct voices come together and keep creating new music.\"</p><p>NPR's Scott Simon talked with Wells and Shaw about <em>Render</em>, the inspiration for the title composition and how the group develops novel vocabularies for making music.
