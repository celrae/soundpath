The Department of Defense recently determined these 13 soldiers died as a result of their wounds during the war, which stretched from the first American casualty in 1956 to the fall of Saigon in 1975. The new names join more than 58,000 others. <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Alex Ashlock was in Washington yesterday for the adding of the new names and brings us this report.</em></p><p>I kept thinking how familiar this was, as I spoke to people at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, Mother&#8217;s Day. They were the families of 13 soldiers whose names have just been engraved on the Memorial Wall.</p><p>There were wives and sons and sisters who took care of their wounded men when they came home from Vietnam. Some did it for many years. It reminded me so much of my parents’ generation, friends of my mom and dad, a couple. The man came home from World War II paralyzed. The woman took care of him the rest of his long life.</p><p>Beth Wilson of Florence, Alabama, did that for Danny Joe Wilson. They got married after Danny came home wounded from the Vietnam War. She couldn&#8217;t remember how many surgeries he had after that. He couldn&#8217;t work, but he lived. He coached Little League. A family friend told me that before Danny died in 2012, kids from the teams he coached, grown up by then, came to the hospital to visit him.</p><p>&#8220;It was really special to come here for this,&#8221; Kathy Lawson said. &#8220;This was something he would have been so excited about. It&#8217;s a bittersweet day.&#8221;</p><p>Thomas Charles Littles of Brewton, Alabama, was drafted in 1966. He was wounded in 1969 during his first tour of duty in Vietnam. He died two years later at the age of 24. Thomas was one of 10 children. His brother Douglas was standing near the panel, which now includes Thomas&#8217;s name.</p><p>&#8220;Some folks would say closure, but it just says he served with pride and it&#8217;s finally being recognized by this great memorial,&#8221; Douglas Littles said.</p><p>One of the other names added to the Wall over the weekend was Michael Noel Faherty. There was no family there to see it though. He emigrated to Boston from Galway, Washington, and joined the Army in 1966, as a combat photographer. He caught malaria in Vietnam and died in 1968. His name is now engraved on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, but he&#8217;s buried in Rahoon Cemetery in Galway City, Ireland.</p><h4>Names Added To The Memorial</h4><p>Staff Sgt.
