I met Ben Bradlee just a few times. But it seemed to me they shared a certain swagger of charm, wit and street smarts, even if those streets were in Georgetown.</p><p>Of all the photos of Ben Bradlee that appeared this week, I thought the best glimpse of character was in one taken when he left the federal courthouse in 1971 with Katharine Graham, publisher and co-owner of <em>The Washington Post</em>.</p><p>They had gone to court to fight for the right of the <em>Post</em> to run excerpts leaked to them from the so-called Pentagon Papers, a Defense Department study that documented how the Johnson administration had lied about the war in Vietnam — it's important not to use a more polite word — to Congress and the public.</p><p>In that photo on the courthouse steps, Bradlee and Graham are laughing.</p><p>I like to think Ben had just muttered something like, \"Kay, we're gonna fight this if it takes all your money!\"</p><p>But when the case was still in doubt, they looked like two people doing what they believed in — and enjoying it.</p><p>Years ago, Frank Mankiewicz got so angry over something I reported that he called me to his office and punted a typewriter. I hope you understand that we became ever better friends thereafter.</p><p>Ben and Frank weren't talking heads who opined about the principles of journalism. They loved the game: scoops, big stories, and rattled gilded cages. <br />They moved comfortably among the rich and powerful, but were profane in the best way: they respected effort, irreverence and wit more than power. They could be famously inattentive managers — when Frank left NPR, the network was deeply in debt — but inspired motivators.</p><p>Both men enjoyed their prime in a different time for the news business. NPR was once directly subsidized by the federal government; that percentage is very small today. Bradlee ran a one-paper monopoly in the nation's capital for a rich owner who was willing to lose money for a while. When <em>The Washington Post</em> was sold last year, it was for $250 million dollars — just what Albert Pujols is paid to play baseball.</p><p>I'm not sure that Ben Bradlee or Frank Mankiewicz ever had a business plan to create national institutions. But they did what they loved and made it stand for something.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
