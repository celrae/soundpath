But unlike the old subprime loans there are stricter rules. For one, the income of the borrower has to be verified now.<br />\n<br />\n\"We look at everybody's income,\" says Perl. \"We look at their debt in relationship to that income. We look closely the property and if they can qualify under our guidelines even with some credit dings here and there, we will in fact make the loan.\"<br />\n<br />\nThose credit dings mean that borrowers pay a lot to get a loan from Citadel. Upfront fees can top $10,000. Interest rates start at about 8 percent. But Perl also requires a minimum down payment of 25 percent. So far Perl has raised $200 million to lend. He expects Citadel will have a lot of competition in the next year and a half. \"What you are going to find is instead of a $200 million marketplace today, this is going to be a several billion dollar marketplace,\" Perl says.<br />\n<br />\nUnlike 2006, when anyone with a pulse could get a loan, there are restraints on the growth of the subprime industry. New regulations have tightened credit standards and that means a safer market than the one of the early 2000's. But it also makes it harder for lower-income borrowers to get a mortgage.<br />\n<br />\n\"To be blunt, I don't think we want to have a housing market or a mortgage market that favors middle-aged, white rich people. We'd like a market that's more diverse that reflects the population,\" says Guy Cecala, the publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance.<br />\n<br />\nThis, he says, is the great balancing act that regulators have to maneuver. How do you prevent predatory lending and still make loans available to first-time buyers with less than perfect credit?<br />\n<br />\nHenry Pontell doesn't have the answer to that question. But he's been studying financial regulation and white collar crime for decades. He says the ultimate cause of the Lehman collapse was incentives that allowed financial companies' CEO's and managers to make money on loans that were destined to fail.<br />\n<br />\n\"We should have learned how perverse environments that encourage heads of firms to take incredibly dangerous risks and sometimes illegal risks is something the government needs to take seriously,\" says Pontell.<br />\n<br />\nThe regulations that were put in place have made subprime lending safer. But Pontell says the bigger problem, the problem of perverse incentives, was not addressed in the regulatory changes enacted after the financial crisis, \"and until the government gets it and until policy makers get it and until people get it and demand that changes get made in the law, I would predict that we are going to relive these debacles every 8 to 10 years.\" And says Pontell, these debacles are not a natural part of the business cycle. It's the way we've structured the financial industry.<br />\n<br />\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/after-lehman\"><img src=\"http://www.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/200x200/public/field_images/2013/09/bankruptcylehman.jpg?itok=4ltgcjBP\" alt=\"\" /></a></div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/after-lehman\"></a>\n<p><strong><span>Lehman's Legacy: A Timeline</span></strong> <em>Follow the key events before and after the Lehman Brothers collapse, and see how the financial crisis unfolded. <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/after-lehman\">Follow the timeline</a></em></p>\n</div>\n</div></div>","published":"2013-09-12T17:57:22+00:00","tags":["APM","After Lehman","Economy","Housing","home loans","mortgage","mortgage crisis","subprime"],"itags":["PMP:Marketplace_PMP","Marketplace for Thursday, September 12, 2013","086493081ca058a48df2cf43a887fcab","Marketplace"],"teaser":"Mortgage lenders fueled the financial collapse by marketing subprime loans to people who couldn't afford them.
