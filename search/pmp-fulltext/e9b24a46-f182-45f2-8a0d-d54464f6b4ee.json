Why the show is so good, why the show is so different, why the show has been so well received, and have we mentioned how much we adore the lead, Gina Rodriguez? (If you haven't ever read the speech she gave at press tour about turning down <em>Devious Maids</em>, which I reference in the discussion, you <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/gina-rodriguez-latina-speech-jane-the-virgin#.ybM2jl1g9\">really should</a>.)</p><p>And then we take the opportunity of the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2015/01/13/376991408/the-20-greatest-things-about-this-amazing-the-boy-next-door-trailer\">new Jennifer Lopez film</a> <em>The Boy Next Door </em>to talk ... well, first to talk about how bonkers the movie <em>The Boy Next Door</em> is, and then to talk about the great tradition of sex thrillers, through old film noir and the <em>Fatal Attraction </em>anxiety era up to now. We talk about what happens when you play around with the gender politics of this kind of film, how Beyonce might fare in a fist fight, and lots more. (You'd be surprised how much material we can get from the morality plays that are the erotic thrillers of cinema.)</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2015/01/21/378681056/seth-avett-jessica-lea-mayfield-somebody-that-i-used-to-know\">two</a> upcoming <a href=\"http://www.glenhansardmusic.com/songofgoodhope/?p=1756\">tribute</a> records. Glen is happy about a new <a href=\"http://screenrant.com/wet-hot-american-summer-netflix-casting-trailer/\">teaser trailer</a> in which basically nothing happens and a show that's recently wrapped up. Barrie is happy about the HBO show <em>Togetherness</em> and a recent episode she loved of a show we've often recommended.
