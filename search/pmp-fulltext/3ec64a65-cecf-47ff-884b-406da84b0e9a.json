Segregation was in full force, and white-owned banks did not cross the color line to make loans.</span></p>\n<p><span>That’s where Illinois Service Federal came in. As the bank’s CEO, Norman Williams, tells the story: “We were started in 1934 by 13 African-American men with $7,000.”</span></p>\n<p><span>One of those 13 founders was his father.</span></p>\n<p><span>“The bank grew very slowly,” Williams says. “Its mission was simply to provide home loans and help people open savings accounts.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Today, with around $110 million in assets, the bank still has deeply loyal customers— like Clifford Rome.&nbsp;</span><span>In addition to Peach’s, he runs a catering business, an art gallery and another restaurant on King Drive — and Rome says he has kept multiple accounts with Illinois Service for years.</span></p>\n<p><span>He recalls his first visit to the bank. “Once I walked in the doors, it’s like a throwback,” he says, laughing.

It’s here.”</span></p>\n<p><span>However, the financial crisis and the recession hit banks like Illinois Service especially hard. African-Americans, like Norman Williams’s borrowers, were more likely than others to lose their jobs.
