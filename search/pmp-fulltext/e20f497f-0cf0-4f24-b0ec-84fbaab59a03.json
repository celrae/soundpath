It was the ninth most frequently banned book in the 1990s, and a Texas pastor checked it out of a local library and refused to return it.</p><p>Then there was North Carolina Senator Bob Smith, who read from the book on the Senate floor in attempt to pass an amendment to stop federal aid to school districts that &#8220;carried programs that promoted homosexuality,&#8221; an amendment referred to as the &#8220;no promo homo amendment.&#8221;</p><p>Despite the protests, the book was hit, especially among young children who were largely smitten by Heather and the book&#8217;s message that everyone&#8217;s family, regardless of whether it includes two mothers, grandparents, single parents or two dads, is perfectly normal.</p><p>So, 25 years later, with 37 states allowing gay marriage and more moving in that direction, is the book still relevant?
