So of course plenty of regulations are great, but I have heard parents complain about excessive regulations, about a building having to be completed for so long before kids can start, the number of people required per child. Things like this can play into it and can raise the price, and depending on the standards of any given local area, that can push the cost up. But that is just one thing.

That is huge and in some places that’s like paying a second rent. That’s gargantuan.

It’s not always, but often women end up bearing the brunt of childcare taking on a lot of it themselves and more often than not women will be the ones who stay home to take care of a child. And so yes, there is the potential that this is keeping women out of the labor force, this is bringing down their labor force participation. And one case study that you can look at against the U.S. is France, where there are more state supports for child care.
