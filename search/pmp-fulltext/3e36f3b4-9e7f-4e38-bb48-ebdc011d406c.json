I once asked Felix, \"Do you end up having to listen to a lot of really bad music and just a few good tunes?\" and, \"What if we don't have enough good music to do a once-a-week show?\"</p><p>Years have passed since I asked those panicked questions, and I'm happy to say that it's never been a problem. Yes, we get our fair share of demo records from aspiring polka-meets-reggaeton bands — we don't, really, and that actually sounds cool, so polkaton bands should send us their demos — but we also get so much fantastic music that a lot ends up getting cut out. This week, we share some of the artists we feel we neglected unfairly in 2014.</p><p>We also want to hear from you! Next week, we're doing a show about listeners' favorite music of the year, so be sure to let us know who's been rocking your world.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
