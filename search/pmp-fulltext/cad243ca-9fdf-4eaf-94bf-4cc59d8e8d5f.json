NC&#8217;s geology doesn&#8217;t support it</a> &#8211;&#8221;Both the pro-fracking and the anti-fracking people ignore the geology of North Carolina. Petroleum (oil and gas) experts, however, do not ignore it. The Energy Information Agency of the U.S government shows large areas that fracking opens to oil and gas production. The largest is the Marcellus-Utica complex of western New York, western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and West Virginia. Numerous other areas are scattered to the west. None of them is east of the southern Appalachians, and the EIA shows nothing in North Carolina.<span style=\"font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.5em\">&#8220;</span></p><p><a title=\"NOLA Fracking Fight\" href=\"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/06/st_tammany_parish_council_take.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>New Orleans Times-Picayune</strong>: St. Tammany Parish Council will wage court fight against fracking</a> &#8212; &#8220;In front of a large sign-carrying, anti-fracking crowd, the St. Tammany Parish Council decided Thursday night to go to court to fight a proposed oil drilling project near Mandeville.
