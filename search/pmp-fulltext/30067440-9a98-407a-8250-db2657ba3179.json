And that is huge because students don’t come into the university knowing that if individuals are intoxicated, they are not able to give consent.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the lack of funding for the new policies</strong></p><p>“The state and UC system task force are not attaching funding to this. At the end of day, without funding, these positions can’t be created overnight. And across the board, our state and the UC system need to have our budget reflect this as a priority. And that’s not the case right now. It’s great that they’re taking a lot of effort and putting a lot of attention to this, but it’s another thing to actually put money and funds towards the creation of positions to aid survivors in the process.”</p><p><strong>On changing campus culture</strong></p><p>“It’s about redefining how people view their responsibility to one another in these contexts. And for men to really understand that it’s their responsibility to check with their partner, that that individual is able to give consent—and vice versa. It’s about establishing that as a community principle regardless of who the individual is.”</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Rishi Ahuja</strong>, a senior at UC Berkeley who works as a student advocate for sexual assault victims and a member of the UC Sexual Assault Task Force.
