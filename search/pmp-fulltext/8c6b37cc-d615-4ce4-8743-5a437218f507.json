For that, you can thank the decision to roll back quantitative easing in the U.S., and the European Central Bank's decision to do more QE in the EU. Some people love a strong dollar, but others don't. We look at why the dollar's doing better, and who the winners and losers are this time round. Meanwhile, oil prices are falling in part because the global production of oil is reducing Saudi Arabia's&nbsp;— and therefore OPEC's&nbsp;— influence. Saudi Arabia was the swing state that could turn production up or down to affect prices. Now it's keeping production up despite falling prices to avoid losing foreign buyers. Plus, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is getting into the auto market. The company is buying the Van Tuyl Group, which is America's fifth-largest dealership. The purchase price is unknown, but we do know that whatever Buffett does, others watch very closely.
