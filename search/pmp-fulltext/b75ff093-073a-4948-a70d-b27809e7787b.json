The documents had been kept secret for decades in some cases and the church says it is releasing them now in an effort to be transparent and to help bring healing to the victims of abuse. But abuse survivors say they feel betrayed, duped and deceived. They and their attorneys contend they were not allowed to help prepare the document release and therefore don't know what's still being hidden from public view.","itags":["npr_api","362086777"],"guid":"b75ff093-073a-4948-a70d-b27809e7787b","contentencoded":"<p><div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
