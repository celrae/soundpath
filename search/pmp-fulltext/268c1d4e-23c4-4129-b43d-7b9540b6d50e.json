USA!). It made modest money last weekend despite (?) being a big and splashy production from the Wachowskis, who made <em>The Matrix </em>and, well, not really <em>The Matrix </em>again after that. But joined by our pal Chris Klimek, we, perhaps surprisingly, found it more amiably entertaining than its press, and while some of you are likely to catch it on home video rather than in theaters, we come around to a nice, solid \"not as bad as a lot of people are telling you it is.\"</p><p>We also take on the topic of on-screen chemistry.

Does Channing Tatum mostly have it with Jonah Hill?</p><p>As always, we close the show with what's making us happy this week.
