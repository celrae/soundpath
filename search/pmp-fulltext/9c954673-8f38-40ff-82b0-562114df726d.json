His research focuses on how we interact by email, text message and social media, seeking to understand how technology mediates communication. He argues that while the impersonality of online interaction can encourage mild fibbing, the fact that it leaves a permanent record of verifiable facts actually keeps us on the straight and narrow. Hancock has also studied how we form impressions of others online, how we manage others' impressions of ourselves, and how individual personalities interact with online groups.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
