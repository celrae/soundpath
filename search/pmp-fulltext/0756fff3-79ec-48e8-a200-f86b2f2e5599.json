Months later, the search continues.</p><p>\"From the school standpoint, we haven't had anyone terribly interested,\" says Denise Plante, the principal of Jackman's Forest Hills Consolidated School District.</p><p>There have been inquiries from people around the country and even overseas, but because the town is so isolated, the scholarship's goal is really to get a student familiar with the area to train and come back.</p><p>There is one student, a high school senior, who might be willing to take the plunge: \"One of his top three plans is to go to be trained and to earn certification to be a plumber and return to town,\" says Plante.</p><p>If that student does decide to train, it could still be years before he's certified. Until then, Plante jokes, \"We'll save our flushes.\"</p><p>There are some stopgap options, she explains: \"We have some plumbers that kinda do handy work that may not be certified, and some that travel.\"</p><p>This scholarship was established after a couple moved back to town and reached their wits' end trying to get a water softener installed in their home.</p><p>\"We've been chasing plumbers for two years. So, yeah, we'd like to see a plumber,\" says Larry Harth, who established the scholarship with his wife, Sheryl Hughey Harth.</p><p>He says they have heard from a lot of towns in similar situations â€” and from interested candidates who aren't familiar with Maine. But in a small town so isolated that it's been designated as an \"on-shore island,\" Harth says, it's important to have a local, permanent plumber.</p><p>\"We really would love to have people learn a skill and return to town. Plain and simple,\" says Harth.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
