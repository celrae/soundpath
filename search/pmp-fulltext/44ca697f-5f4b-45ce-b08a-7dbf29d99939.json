They were — to quote the message of acceptance — \"one of the select few\" to be accepted into Carnegie Mellon's prestigious Master of Science in Computer Science program.</p><p>A young woman in India who was accepted wrote on Facebook that she quit her job, bolstered by this act of faith in her future. Her boyfriend proposed marriage.</p><p>Ben Leibowitz of Stamford, Conn., went out to dinner to celebrate with his parents. Imagine the toasts of dewy-eyed pride and esteem that parents and child must have lifted to each other.</p><p>There was a follow-up email from the school by the time Leibowitz got home. The 800 \"select few\" might have opened them with excitement, thinking the messages were about course registration or graduate housing.</p><p>But instead the emails said: \"Sorry. Those acceptances were a mistake.\"</p><p>\"This error was the result of serious mistakes in our process for generating acceptance letters,\" said <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/errors-made-notifying-csd-masters-program-applicants\">a school statement</a>. \"We understand the disappointment created by this mistake, and deeply apologize to the applicants for this miscommunication.\"</p><p>But do school officials already sitting on their degrees in their offices really understand that disappointment?</p><p>To feel rewarded and recognized one moment, and begin to dream of the rest of your life; then have that dream smashed in the next, by some nebulous, unnamed error.</p><p>Ben Leibowitz, the young man who celebrated with his parents, <a href=\"http://wkbn.com/2015/02/17/carnegie-mellon-tells-800-rejected-applicants-theyre-in/\">told the Associated Press</a>, \"It was brutal. Now I have to clean up the mess. I'm calling all my relatives, I'm going, 'I'm sorry it's not happening.' \"</p><p>The young woman in India who had quit her job and accepted a proposal of marriage asked, \"What do I do now?\"</p><p>Carnegie Mellon's computer science school is tied with Stanford, MIT and the University of California, Berkeley for No. 1 in the most recent <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> rankings; though it seems a bad week for Carnegie Mellon to chant, \"We're number one!\"</p><p>MIT, Johns Hopkins and others have made similar acceptance letter mistakes in recent years.</p><p>I hope one of the snubbed 800 will use their botched rejection as a spur and go on to win whatever is the Oscar of computer programming. They've already learned a valuable lesson: Experts make mistakes, too.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
