She was 86.</p><p><em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young examines the life and legacy of Maya Angelou with poet <strong>Kevin Young</strong>, who is a professor of English and creative writing at Emory University.</p><h4>Interview Highlights: Kevin Young</h4><p><strong>On Angelou&#8217;s voice</strong></p><p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s one of the things we&#8217;ll miss most, in the broadest terms, is her voice &#8212; both how she spoke and that melodic, yet fierce tone. It had this kind of great depth to it, this undertone &#8212; but also, her voice on the page. And I think I remember reading the memoir &#8216;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,&#8217; and it was so powerful &#8212; a sort of reckoning  and a remedy at the same time. It has that great title, taken from Dunbar&#8230;&#8217;We Wear the Mask,&#8217; and, you know, taking that and really channeling the feeling of his poems, which had always been held close to African-American writers and the public &#8230; and touched a similar kind of nerve about survival. And the voice, again, singing despite it all.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On her use of words</strong></p><p>&#8220;I think she had a way with words, of course, both in speaking and especially in that memoir, and I think they were both comforting. I was re-reading &#8216;And Still I Rise&#8217; and how she talks about, &#8216;You may tread me in the dirt, but still, like dust, I&#8217;ll rise.&#8217; I love that image.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On overcoming her personal struggles and becoming a champion for others</strong></p><p>&#8220;I think about the silence that she survived &#8230; apparently, it was six years &#8212; I think it was one of the more incredible parts of the memoir &#8212; and then emerging with that incredible voice. And you can hear that context, you know, working behind that poem in a powerful way. And I think she really gave voice, in the broadest sense, both to poetry as a public forum, but also specifically to the voices of black women, and I think she not just represented that rising spirit, but also embodied it.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.english.emory.edu/people/faculty/young.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Young</a></strong>, author of six poetry collections and editor of five other, and professor of English and creative writing at Emory University.
