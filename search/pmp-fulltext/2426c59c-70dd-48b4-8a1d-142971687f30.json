All they're waiting for, they say, is for Iraqi forces to isolate the city from the south.</p><p>But the head of Kurdistan's security council tells Ari, \"I wish I could tell you the Iraqi army is ready for that, but it's not.\"</p><p>The battle plan includes a main force of five Iraqi brigades and three Kurdish brigades, the U.S. official told reporters Thursday. And Tom says the U.S. military has \"pretty much cherry-picked\" the Iraqi force for the operation. He adds that the Iraqis would be backed by U.S. air power.</p><p>While the U.S. military also expects to provide logistical, tactical and surveillance support, it hasn't yet been decided whether American military advisers might join the ground force to coordinate air strikes.</p><p>The U.S. official said that the spring offensive would be timed to come before Ramadan and the heat of summer, saying \"it becomes problematic if it goes much later than that,\" according to military news outlet <a href=\"http://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/centcom-us-iraq-mission-to-take-back-mosul-to-launch-in-april-or-may-1.330664\">Stars and Stripes</a>.</p><p>He added that if it's determined the Iraqi troops or preparations aren't ready, the operation would be pushed back.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
