We have live music.</p><p>Almost every week here at NPR's offices in Washington, D.C., someone performs in the NPR Music department — specifically, at the desk of Bob Boilen, host of <em>All Songs Considered</em>. He's had <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/167564228/the-polyphonic-spree-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\">big bands</a> behind his desk <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/384964401/mucca-pazza-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\">that seem too big to possibly fit into an office cubicle</a>. Big personalities like <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/133687905/adele-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\">Adele</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/359661053/t-pain-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\">T-Pain</a> have performed there, too. It's a series we call Tiny Desk Concerts.</p><p>Late last year, NPR Music launched a contest to give an undiscovered band a chance to play behind the Tiny Desk. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2015/02/12/385418281/the-tiny-desk-concert-contest-winner-is\" target=\"_blank\">On Thursday morning, the judges announced their winner</a>, chosen from nearly 7,000 entries. He calls himself Fantastic Negrito, and he joined NPR's Rachel Martin from a studio in Oakland, Calif., to talk about his winning entry, an original song called \"Lost In A Crowd.\"</p><p>\"I like going out and looking at people, and they inspire me so much,\" the musician says. \"I was at a store here in the Bay Area and I looked at the face of this cashier, and he just looked so distressed, and so tired and overworked ... and that moment right there, I was like, 'whoa, that's it!' And then I went and ran to the parking lot and started writing these lyrics.\"</p><p>This isn't Fantastic Negrito's first act as a musician. Today, he's unsigned — a requirement for contest entrants — but back in the mid-1990s, he led <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-x-factor-mw0000124694\" target=\"_blank\">a band that scored a contract with the major label Interscope</a>, which he says offered excitement and frustration in equal measure.</p><p>\"The minute I signed that record deal, my — my creative life just ended,\" he says. \"I really didn't understand the business side of music, probably like a lot of artists, and it was pretty devastating to me.\"</p><p>That phase of his life ended with a car accident, which put him in a coma for several weeks and left him with lingering injuries.</p><p>Years later, he has returned to music and adopted the name Fantastic Negrito — a phrase some will hear as a term of endearment, others as potentially offensive. The musician says it comes out of a love and fascination for black roots music of the early blues era.</p><p>\"To me it's a celebration of blackness,\" he says. \" 'Fantastic' is self-explanatory, you know? And the 'Negrito' is a way to open up blackness to everyone — you know, make it playful, international. It's extremely positive in my view; it's my affair with this music. And it's like gold! I feel like it's something that everyone should know about.\"</p><p>It's safe to imagine a lot more people will know about Fantastic Negrito now. In describing how \"Lost In A Crowd\" captured the attention of the contest judges, Bob Boilen invokes a specific quality: rawness. It's a concept the musician is quite fond of.</p><p>\"The idea of 'raw' music, to me, is honesty: getting people to feel you with the least amount of production possible, the shortest distance traveled emotionally, sonically,\" he says. \"When I started listening more to this music that influenced me, I felt the rawness. I could hear it in the music, and it's something that I related to.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
