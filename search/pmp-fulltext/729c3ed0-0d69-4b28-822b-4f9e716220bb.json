I get that not everyone realizes the implications of travelling in Iceland. But this really gets up my nose,\" Sigmundsdóttir says. \"Rescue teams are currently trying to reach two men who were traversing Vatnajökull glacier on cross-country skis and got caught in a nasty storm that I understand is blowing in Iceland as we speak. They have lost some of their equipment, including their tent.\"</p>\n<p>Of course, such rescues are fairly routine. But this one comes with a twist.</p>\n<p>\"One of their fellow travellers had to be rescued a few days ago, as he was ill,\" Sigmundsdóttir adds. \"So rescue teams went up there and got him. At the time they expressly told the other two that the weather forecast was terrible, and that they would do well to accompany them back to civilization. They refused. And now they have to be rescued. \"</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"506\" width=\"900\" alt=\"Snowmobile rescue crews work to reach stranded skiers on Vatnajökull glacier, Iceland.\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/ICE2_0.jpg?itok=VSgWLCne\" title=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Snowmobile rescue crews work to reach stranded skiers on Vatnajökull glacier, Iceland.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"image__credit\">\n    <span class=\"image__credit-label\">\n      Credit:\n    </span>\n    <p>Courtesy Björgunarfélag Hornafjarðar</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Sigmundsdóttir praises Iceland's search and rescue teams as dedicated volunteers who often put their lives at risk.
