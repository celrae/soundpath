Police and witnesses disagreed on whether the shots came from the demonstration or a nearby hill. </p>\n<p>Protests, mass arrests, and demonstrations are all-too-common in the St. Louis suburb since the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in August. This latest shooting, however, is the first time police have been wounded.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/potomaker\">Ansgar Graw</a>, is a Washington-based reporter for the German newspaper <a href=\"http://www.welt.de/\">Die Welt</a>. He's covered various conflict zones across the globe, from Iraq to the civil war in Georgia. But it was in Ferguson where he was <a href=\"http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-08-19/veteran-conflict-reporter-had-go-ferguson-get-arrested-first-time\">arrested</a> while reporting on the shooting and aftermath. When he heard about the shooting of two police officers on Thursday, he wasn't all that surprised.</p>\n<p>\"I think it was to be expected, or at least not coming totally out of the blue, that in this atmosphere of violence and escalation over the months that some troublemaker in the background would use firearms and escalate this even more,\" Graw says. He says his time reporting in Ferguson as a foreigner did shed light on race relations in the US. \"I think we could see last summer that this debate about racism, about racial bias is not a discussion about historic events. In some parts of the country it's still a problem, and you have to deal with it.\"</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\"><p>Ferguson, West Florissant, right now: National Guard at liquor &amp; cigarillo store where <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MichaelBrown?src=hash\">#MichaelBrown</a> tragedy started <a href=\"http://t.co/eBwF3NuJYQ\">pic.twitter.com/eBwF3NuJYQ</a></p>\n<p>— Ansgar Graw (@Potomaker) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Potomaker/status/537756909814956032\">November 26, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>Here are a few of the events that led up to Wednesday's shooting:</p>\n<p><strong>August 9, 2014:</strong> Michael Brown, 18, is shot and killed by a 28 year-old officer, Darren Wilson.
