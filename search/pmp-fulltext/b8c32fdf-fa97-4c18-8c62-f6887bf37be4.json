What sets Bellows apart from thousands of other guitar-bass-drums bands out there is its heart. Oliver Kalb sings about things that matter to him in ways that matter to me. His sing-song, matter-of-fact phrasing and guitar melodies are memorable, and the harmonies are lovely, with the staying power to drift in my head for days on end.</p><p>I first heard Bellows when I went to see another Brooklyn band, Eskimeaux; the two share many members in live performance, and both belong to an artist collective known as The Epoch. It's a thrill to share these enchanting songs with a wider audience.</p><p><strong>Set List</strong></p><ul><li>\"Sacred Heart\"</li><li>\"Hello Morning\"</li><li>\"White Sheet\"</li></ul><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p><em>Producers: Bob Boilen, Maggie Starbard; Audio Engineer: Brian Jarboe; Videographers: Nick Michael, Maggie Starbard; Assistant Producer:</em> <em>Morgan McCloy; photo Morgan McCloy/NPR</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
