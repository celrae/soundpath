If you look at especially your recent roles, “Holy Motors” and this, it really feels like you’re almost playing with that image of yourself as a model, especially in “Holy Motors” where you play a model who is literally abducted in the middle of a photo shoot and sort of dragged by this homunculus crazy man into a crypt.</p>\n<br />\n<p>First of all I want to ask, would you, could you do one or the other? Would you want a career where you had to do one or the other?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote data-pullquote=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> Well this is the funny thing is, I never really… <q>I didn’t start off modeling. It’s been a product of me being an actress. I love that aspect of my career, but I’m still squeamish when you say model. I’m like “No, you know I’m not.”</q></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Why?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> I don’t know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> I mean I see in these roles a kind of ambivalence. I mean, this role is very un-glamourous. It’s a really gritty role, and in “Holy Motors” you’re obviously taking the idea of a model and sort of poking fun at it.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> Well yeah, but for me it wasn’t so much that she was a model, it was that she was just miserable in this empty world that was so ridiculous. And here comes this creature, this beast who, in my eyes he didn’t kidnap her, he saved her.</p>\n<br />\n<p>You could replace that with being an actress as well. It just seemed I think a little bit more visually pleasing for me to be standing on a tomb.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s right, that photo, it’s a photo shoot at Père Lachaise that the character is undergoing.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> Yeah, and that’s how he got me. Père Lachaise is one of my favorite places in the whole world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s how you were persuaded to make the film?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> Well it was Leos Carax, the director, he said “You’re gonna film in Paris,” and I’m like, “Oh cool. Paris is cool.” And he’s like, “At Père Lachaise,” and I was like, “What?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> For those who don’t know, like, Oscar Wilde is buried at Père Lachaise.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> Oscar Wilde is buried there and has the most beautiful epitaph. It’s gorgeous. And Maria Callas and Jim Morrison. It’s just, like, city of tombs. It’s my dream, it’s beautiful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> It’s really your dream?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> Well, I don’t know… Yeah it’s kind of my dream. I have – I’m gonna sound kind of crazy but sure – I’ve always loved cemeteries, and that’s just like the epitome of all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s the king mother of all cemeteries for sure.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> That’s the king mother.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> We have two questions that we ask everyone on the show, and the first one is, and I hope I haven’t asked it, if we were to meet you at a dinner party, which question would you least like to be asked?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong>&nbsp;”So, tell us about your film.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Did I do that? I asked you to summarize the film. That’s a little more specific.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote data-pullquote=\"q\">\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> I’m kind of joking, but okay, so we talked about it before, about my condition. <q>If you asked me to summarize something or to explain the plot of something – it could be a great book, my favorite book, – I’d be like “Ah, ooh, um…”</q></p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> I’m sorry. I apologize for asking that question.</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> No, no, no.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> No, no. This is my bad. But here’s a question that we also ask everyone, that maybe is easier. Tell us something we don’t know. And this can be anything about yourself, or anything in the world. A piece of trivia.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> Okay, well it’s not really a piece of trivia, but it’s about me. I’m a total wannabe Egyptologist. I’m obsessed with ancient Egypt.</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> What lead to that, do you think?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> I don’t know. Ever since I was little, I’ve just… I’m going back to the tombs in the cemeteries and everything. I was really drawn to hieroglyphs and I took a class last year actually at UCLA extension, it was really fun. I started learning how to read hieroglyphs. Wow, <em>that</em> is complicated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> Really?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> It was overwhelming. There’s such an order to it. Like, the way a certain bird is facing on the hieroglyph, that’s how you read the hieroglyph.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> That’s the direction you read it in?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> That’s the direction you read it in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Rico Gagliano:</strong> So you don’t necessarily read left to right or right to left?</p>\n<br />\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Eva Mendez:</strong> No, you read the direction the bird is facing. There’s such poetry to it, it’s really beautiful and complicated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br /></div>","audio":[{"href":"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/164871475.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","meta":{"width":null,"height":null,"crop":"primary"}},{"format":"MP3","type":"audio/mpeg","href":"http://play.publicradio.org/pmp/d/podcast/dinnerpartydownload/2013/08/22/0823_mendes_128.mp3","meta":{"api":{"href":"http://api.publicradio.org/audio/v2?ref=pmp&id=apm_audio:/dinnerpartydownload/2013/08/22/0823_mendes","type":"application/json"},"duration":507,"duration_hms":"00:08:27"}}]}
