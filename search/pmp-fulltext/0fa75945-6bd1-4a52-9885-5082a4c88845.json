Before trying his hand at music, Ben Schneider was a visual artist, and that's his handiwork on the album cover. Similarly, Lord Huron's songs spin around a strong visual theme, with an imagined cast of characters.</p><p>\"That's the way I kind of envisioned it: There are all these separate tales from this world,\" Schneider says. \"But they overlap and they tangle. And they collide sometimes.\"</p><p>For <em>Strange Trails</em>, Schneider creates a dark, apocalyptic world, filled with people rising from the dead and howling through the dark. At the audio link, Schneider tells NPR's Melissa Block about the leather-jacketed greaser gang in \"The World Ender,\" a song brought to life in a comic book that accompanies the album.</p><p>There's also Buck Vernon, a \"washed-up rockabilly country singer,\" who narrates \"<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2015/02/10/385093501/hear-a-brand-new-song-by-lord-huron\">Fool For Love</a>,\" and Frankie Lou, a \"lounge singer who performs at this club called George's Place,\" who sings \"Love Like Ghosts.\" Lord Huron even throws a party for the end of the world in \"Until The Night Turns,\" written from the perspective of Johnny, a member of the greaser gang.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
