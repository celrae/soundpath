They also plan to do a video assessment of the area starting this weekend.</p><p>Stabilizing the area is expected to take up to 10 days. Neighborhood residents say they&#8217;re frustrated after warning about problems in the area for years &#8212; noting that neighborhood train tracks were tilted, roads were constantly cracked and the condition of a key retaining wall was questionable.</p><p>The last structural analysis of the area was conducted a year ago, using cameras in underground pipes, and the area was declared structurally sound.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
