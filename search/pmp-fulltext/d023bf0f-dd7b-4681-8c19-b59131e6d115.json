But far too often, the media and authors cast them as sinners or saints, with little deviation from cliches established decades ago.</p><p>That's why I recommend the writer Sam Quinones, and his two collections:<em> True Tales from Another Mexico </em>and <em>Antonio's Gun and Delfino's Dream: True Tales of Mexican Migration. </em></p><p>Read them both, you'll see something rare: his migrant characters are brilliant, maddening, flawed and very human.</p><p>\"I think nuance and complexity form the big beautiful heart of Mexican immigration,\" Quinones writes in the introduction to <em>Antonio's Gun</em>, \"and they are what I seek.\" What epics he found!</p><p>He tells the tales of Mexicans transforming small Midwest towns, of corrupt politicians perverting democracy, a man who came to this country illegally and became a millionaire, and a short Oaxacan named Zeus Garcia who plays basketball like Jordan and Magic.</p><p>\"[Zeus' team] was the best team in the Zapoteco region of Oaxaca,\" Quinones writes, \"though no player was over five-foot nine. Their practices consisted of running uphill for two hours every day with bike-tire tubes filled with sand tied around their ankles ...\"</p><p>The chapters flow like magical realism, but Quinones' background as a crime reporter keeps his prose sharp and marching forward.</p><p>And it's in Quinones' telling that Americans can learn the truth: Mexicans here aren't returning to Mexico. They may say they seek retirement in their ancestral villages, but America's promise gave them visions bigger than what they left. It's a situation that, Quinones writes, has \"enough irony for a Chekhov story.\"</p><p><em>Gustavo Arellano is the editor of </em>OC Weekly<em> and author of </em>Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
