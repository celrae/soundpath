They brought in Mexican muralist Diego Rivera to paint their city. Rivera came with his wife, fellow artist Frida Kahlo.</p>\n<p>The couple made Detroit their home and their canvas for almost a year. Decades later, their work from that period is featured in a new exhibit. <a href=\"http://www.dia.org/calendar/event.aspx?id=4608&amp;iid=\">Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo in Detroit</a>, on view at the <a href=\"http://www.dia.org/\">Detroit Institute of Arts</a> until July 12, explores the tumultuous and creatively explosive year that Rivera and Kahlo spent in Detroit.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"1139\" width=\"900\" alt=\"Frieda and Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, 1931\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/image-248Frieda%20and%20Diego%20Rivera%20-%20Frida%20%28Frieda%29%20Kahlo%2C.jpg?itok=F_Kq3XNj\" title=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Frieda and Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, 1931, oil on canvas.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p> San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Albert M.

The paintings make up a complex tapestry showing “the creation of an automobile, from the smelting to it leaving the factory.\"</p>\n<p>\"All of the other panels are more allegorical, much more symbolic. They deal with the good and the bad, with man and machine, organic vs inorganic, really it's a very complex program,” says DIA director Graham Beal.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"1028\" width=\"900\" alt=\"Detroit Industry, south wall (detail), Diego Rivera, 1932.\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/image-260Detroit%20Industry%20-%20south%20wall%20detail%20-%20Pharmaceutics.jpg?itok=5zviOEYz\" title=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Detroit Industry, south wall (detail), Diego Rivera, 1932.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p> Detroit Institute of Arts</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Rivera captured scenes in Detroit’s bustling automotive plants and in its steel and cement factories. The reactions to the early paintings, says Beal, ranged widely.</p>\n<p>“We have responses from people who were appalled by the notion of turning this great new temple of art into a living billboard, practically, for the Ford Motor Company, so that was one extreme.” On the other extreme, he says, were the workers in these plants who saw themselves in the paintings and who must have felt that Rivera had captured the soul of the city.</p>\n<p>So much so that “one engineer from another motor company remarked that it was extraordinary the way that Rivera had gotten two miles of a production line into these wall murals, and it was coherent to an engineer.”</p>\n<p>The murals now on exhibit at the Institute of Art, says Beal, represent Rivera’s vision of America in the 1930’s. “What you see in great realism is the creation of an automobile. Then you also see depictions of science being used for good, science being used for war. You see chemistry being used in inoculation,\" he explains. \"It encapsulates a modern industrial technical US. Rivera regarded Detroit’s plants as America's pyramids and he was absolutely enraptured. He takes plenty of jabs at capitalism, but in the end this is really a song of praise to American industry.”</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"789\" width=\"900\" alt=\"Detroit Industry, west wall (detail), Diego Rivera, 1932-33, fresco.\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/image-274Detroit%20Industry%2C%20west%20wall%20detail-aviation.jpg?itok=4uwBcz_X\" title=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Detroit Industry, west wall (detail), Diego Rivera, 1932-33, fresco.

So we don't want to be too wishful, but really the murals seem to have taken on a slightly different cast.”</p>\n<p>The Detroit Industrial murals shows Rivera at the height of his artistic powers.  The exhibit also features the much less noticed works Kahlo produced while in Detroit. Beal says this work \"can be seen as the beginning of her development as a mature artist with her own distinct — and distinctive — style.” Before coming to Detroit, Kahlo referenced folk art motifs, \"believing that indigenous and folk culture was an authentic expression of Mexico’s heritage.\" It was in Detroit, Beal says, that Kahlo developed her now-celebrated artistic identity. </p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"784\" width=\"900\" alt=\"Self-Portrait on the Borderline between Mexico and the United States, Frida Kahlo, 1932\" title=\"© 2014 Banco de México Diego Rivera Frida Kahlo Museums Trust, Mexico, D.F. / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/image-292Self%20Portrait%20on%20Borderline%20-%20Frida%20Kahlo.jpg?itok=CYKcCcPR\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Self-Portrait on the Borderline between Mexico and the United States, Frida Kahlo, 1932, oil on metal, Private Collection</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Detroit Institute of Art</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-04-08%2Fnew-exhibit-unravels-story-diego-and-frieda-detroit&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/story/images/image-258Detroit%20Industry%20-%20north%20wall%20detail.jpg","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/image-258detroit-industry-north-wall-detailjpg"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/diego330.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/diego330mp3"}]}
