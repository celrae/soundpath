Borrowers who graduated before 2008 or after 2012 had access to another program, which limits student payments to 15% of income. Monday&#8217;s executive order will extend the initiative to anyone with a federal student loan.&#8221;</p><p><a title=\"WaPo Student Debt\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/05/08/map-where-the-average-student-loan-burden-is-largest/?print=1\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Washington Post</strong>: Where the average student loan burden is largest</a> &#8211; &#8220;Per-student higher education spending, adjusted for inflation, has dropped in all but two states—North Dakota and Alaska—since before the recession, which has been matched by sometimes-dramatic tuition hikes, CBPP found. In Arizona, for example, average inflation-adjusted tuition at a public, four-year college rose more than 80 percent from the 2008 to 2014 fiscal year. On the bright side, however, tuition hikes last year did slow to their lowest level since the early 1980s, thanks to tuition freezes and increased funding across states, the National Conference of State Legislatures reports. &#8220;  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
