And when we have snow days here, everybody stays home. We&#8217;re not going anywhere. So I found myself home, kind of bored, and, you know, going through some stuff too, and I thought, you know, maybe I should distract myself and play some music. You know, I should do something interesting and just fun. And I&#8217;ve never thought about recording it or putting it on YouTube.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It took me about, what, a week to make. After those two snow days, I did some editing, whatever. And I thought I&#8217;d put it on Facebook with a little nice message at the end. Twenty-four hours later, I saw something like 150-something times it got shared on Facebook, and some of my friends were like, &#8216;You should probably post it on YouTube as well, you know, because it&#8217;s a really cool video.&#8217; And I thought, &#8216;Oh, whatever, I&#8217;ll just it and then just forget about it.&#8217; Yeah, forgot about it, and next thing I know, three, four days later, I&#8217;m getting weird messages in my inbox, you know, from YouTube, saying that I was getting comments and likes and all that and subscribers. And I started reading some of them, and some weren&#8217;t even people in Arkansas, or not even in the States. I had messages from Sweden, Japan, Brazil, people saying they had heard it on the radio somewhere. And that&#8217;s basically how it started.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On getting an endorsement from Pharrell himself</strong></p><p>&#8220;I got a comment on one of my views saying, &#8216;Pharrell just tweeted this,&#8217; and I thought, &#8216;Oh, there&#8217;s no way.&#8217; I mean, he&#8217;s never tweeted any cover ever. And I went and checked, and he really did that!&#8221;</p><p><strong>On the personal struggles that inspired the videos</strong></p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to make my story sound like everything&#8217;s perfect. Everything that you hear about the wars going on and things here and there &#8212; now, even though it&#8217;s not the full story, you have to admit there is a lot of that going on. I come from a country that has had war for more than 10 years now, so the war exists. The war kind of &#8212; the war is partly the reason why I&#8217;m here, and the war is, in part, why I&#8217;m making music.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually getting worse every day. People are still dying, and even if it&#8217;s part of the country, it really affects the entire population back home. The economy is, if not the worst, the poorest country in the world. I found out that I wasn&#8217;t going to be getting any support from back home anymore, and because that was my only way to pay for school and for everything that I was doing here, I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to continue as a student at the school I go to. I basically didn&#8217;t know what to do, and I was like, &#8216;I&#8217;m just, you know, I&#8217;m gonna be happy in the moment right now and do something and share some happiness.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8IEas-ou4c\">[Youtube]</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TTioMbNT9I\">[Youtube]</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gWc17vhSAE\">[Youtube]</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/dannewbie\" target=\"_blank\">See all the videos on Dan Newbie&#8217;s YouTube channel</a></li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong>Dan Newbie</strong>, wine glass musician and student in Arkansas.
