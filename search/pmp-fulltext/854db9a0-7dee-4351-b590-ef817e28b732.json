Kerry is working on the diplomatic effort to stem the tide of ISIS, the Sunni militant group Islamic State Of Iraq And Syria.</p><p>ISIS is battling the forces of the Shiite-led government and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. There are conflicting reports today about who&#8217;s in control of the country&#8217;s largest oil refinery, as the fighting continues.</p><p><strong>Andrew Bacevich</strong>, veteran and professor of international relations and history, joined <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Jeremy Hobson to provide an analysis of the situation in Iraq and how the U.S. has responded so far, sending in 300 military advisers and pressing Iraq to form a new government.</p><p>Bacevich originally opposed the war in Iraq and is now worried that the U.S. could become more involved in the country today. He wonders about the United States&#8217; ability to make a difference there.</p><p>&#8220;What capacity do we have to fix what we&#8217;ve broken? I&#8217;d judge our capacity as pretty limited,&#8221; he said.</p><p>He also wonders what happens if President Obama’s approach to the crisis in Iraq, using diplomacy and sending U.S. military advisers, doesn&#8217;t help.</p><p>&#8220;The president’s problem is, of course, going to be that having declared that this is a very, very important issue, a threat to our own security, and having now made a small military investment that fails, then what do you do? And the temptation is going to be very strong to escalate.&#8221;</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/tag/andrew-bacevich\" target=\"_blank\">See more from Andrew Bacevich on <em>Here & Now</em></a></li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/history/faculty/andrew-j-bacevich/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Andrew Bacevich</strong></a>, retired Army colonel and veteran of the Vietnam War.
