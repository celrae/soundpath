The town being chosen means we are number one,\" explains longtime Goodwood resident Bev Northeast.</p>\n<p>Northeast says that even though Goodwood is a great place to live, she understands why it was chosen.</p>\n<p>“Goodwood is a busy, busy community with two major highways dividing it. We have 40 gravel pits around it — how quaint are gravel trucks?”</p>\n<p>Schitt's Creek was created by Eugene Levy and his son Daniel. It airs in the US on Pop TV and in Canada on the CBC.</p>\n<p>And it's already been picked up for a second season, which is good news for Goodwood.</p>\n<p>“We would love to have it go on,\" Northeast says.</p>\n<p>She thinks that the village of Goodwood should advertise its new found fame.</p>\n<p>\"I would really like to see some signage that says ‘Schitt’s Creek was filmed in Goodwood' as you enter — I think that would be really exciting.”</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"1284\" width=\"2282\" alt=\"Goodwood, Ontario\" title=\"Goodwood, Ontario\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/goodwood.jpg\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Goodwood, Ontario</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Greying_Geezer/Flickr</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>As for the show itself?</p>\n<p>“I love it.
