Of course from torture, he has broken bones, his arm was broken in a few places and his leg was broken in a few places,\" she says.</p><p><strong>U.S. Criticism And Aid</strong></p><p>Both the U.S. State Department and the U.N. Human Rights Committee have reported that torture and abuse are common in Uzbek prisons.</p><p>But for years, the United States has provided aid to Karimov's government, largely to secure a critical route for transporting supplies to Afghanistan.</p><p>Nisha Biswal, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Central Asia, visited Uzbekistan last month.</p><p>For the first time, she says, the talks on human rights issues included local human rights groups, a development that she calls a breakthrough.</p><p>\"We absolutely have talked about the specific cases of individuals that Human Rights Watch and other organizations, as well as we put in our human rights report, to urge some sort of amnesty or clemency, on humanitarian grounds, for these individuals to be released,\" Biswal says.</p><p>But she adds that Uzbekistan is still vital to stability in Afghanistan, providing it with electricity and a vital rail link.</p><p>U.S. troops are scheduled withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of 2016.</p><p>In the meantime, Biswal says that despite \"deep human rights concerns,\" it's better for the U.S. to remain engaged with Karimov.</p><p>\"It's a combination of the right balance of pressure, partnership and a certain amount of strategic patience in how change can take place,\" she says.</p><p>Russia also has been shoring up its relationship with Karimov.</p><p>President Vladimir Putin visited in December, amid announcements that Russia would forgive $865 million of Uzbekistan's debt.</p><p>Putin said Russia shares Uzbekistan's concerns about Islamist extremism making its way from Afghanistan after NATO withdraws.</p><p>He called Uzbekistan Russia's \"priority partner\" in the region.</p><p>Human Rights Watch's Swerdlow agrees that Uzbekistan is important, but says a country that's ruled by fear and human rights abuses will be an unstable ally in the future.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
