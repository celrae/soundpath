But those shelters don&#8217;t provide protection from wind, rain or cold. And they don&#8217;t protect against intruders. There&#8217;s also no way to bring electricity inside, leaving residents to heat and cook with dangerous fires.</p><p>Now, the <a href=\"http://www.ikeafoundation.org/programmes/\" target=\"_blank\">Ikea Foundation</a> has teamed up with UNHCR and the not-for-profit group <a href=\"http://www.bettershelter.org/press/unhcr-signs-for-10000-flat-pack-shelters/\" target=\"_blank\">Better Shelter</a> to create just that: a better shelter for refugees. In typical Ikea fashion, it comes in a single box and takes about four hours to assemble while requiring no additional tools.</p><p>A prototype is currently being tested by refugees in Syria and Ethiopia, and another 10,000 shelters are expected to be shipped this summer.</p><p>The Ikea Foundation&#8217;s head of strategic planning, <strong>Jonathan Spampinato</strong>, joins <em><a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here & Now&#8217;</a></em>s Robin Young from Amsterdam to discuss the new shelters and the issues he hopes they will solve.</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.ikeafoundation.org/about-us/our-staff/\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathan Spampinato</a>,Â </strong>head of strategic planning at the Ikea Foundation.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
