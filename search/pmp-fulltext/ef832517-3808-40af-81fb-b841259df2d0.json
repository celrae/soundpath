In recognition that we are soon to see the live-action <em>Maleficent </em>coming from Disney, we chat about fairy tales. \"These are stories we tell our kids to get them to abandon us,\" Glen says. \"We're giving them the psychic armor, the psychic tools, to say goodbye.\" We talk about old fairy tales, Disney-fied versions, and Glen's recognition that Germany hasn't had an easy time of it with their own versions. And Barrie reminds us that for many kids, a fairy tale â€” even <em>Frozen </em>-- is a way to process things that are frightening. We manage to fit in some Sondheim, some silly voices, and Glen's nursery school memories.</p><p>In our second segment, it's network upfronts season, and it's quiz time. That means that without <em>in any way </em>passing judgment on a bunch of shows we've never seen and have barely heard of, there is fun to be had with the strange marketing goofballery that goes on at this time of year.</p><p>And as always we close the show with what's making us happy this week. Stephen is happy about a newly available beer from three flopsy-haired old pals. Glen is happy about a <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17591970-black-is-the-color?from_search=true\" target=\"_blank\">graphic novel</a> (!) that he says is not for everyone, but as he says, most good things aren't. Barrie is happy about <a href=\"http://www.spike.com/shows/bar-rescue\" target=\"_blank\">a show</a> starring a man who is, as she points out, very serious about drinking (as a business, not a hobby). And I am happy about a wonderfully written and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122337.The_Devil_s_Candy?from_search=true\" target=\"_blank\">very enlightening book</a> about the miseries of Hollywood production.</p><p>Find us on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pchh\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> or follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nprmonkeysee\">me</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/idislikestephen\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ghweldon\" target=\"_blank\">Glen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/bhardymon\" target=\"_blank\">Barrie</a>, producers <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jessica_reedy\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/lmigaki\" target=\"_blank\">Lauren</a> and <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nickfountain\" target=\"_blank\">Nick</a>, and our dear pal <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/mikekatzif\" target=\"_blank\">Mike</a>.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
