So, starting with Melbourne's Tessa Kum, they volunteered to ride the trains and buses alongside Muslims, using a hashtag that exploded in a matter of hours.","contentencoded":"<p>Tessa Kum was watching the Sydney hostage crisis unfold on social media when she saw a Facebook post by a woman “that pretty much broke my heart.”</p>\n<p>“There was a woman who observed another woman on a train just silently remove her hijab. And when she got off the train she approached that woman on the station and simply said, ‘Put it back on. I’ll walk with you,'\" Kum, of Melbourne, Australia, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-30479306\">told the BBC</a>. \"And the woman who had removed the hijab cried and hugged her. Nobody should have to live like this.\"</p>\n<p>The post inspired Kum to support other fearful Muslims, so she took to Twitter: \"If you reg take the #373 bus b/w Coogee/MartinPl, wear religious attire, &amp; don't feel safe alone: I'll ride with you,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sirtessa/status/544363242655449088\">she tweeted</a>.
