The upsets so far mean <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/03/22/292801520/buffetts-billion-dollars-are-safe-as-upsets-bust-brackets\" target=\"_blank\">no one's going to win $1 billion</a> from Warren Buffett and Quicken Loans, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/03/23/293278941/nations-last-perfect-bracket-busted-by-syracuse-loss\" target=\"_blank\">that there are no perfect brackets</a> among the millions that fans filled out for Yahoo Sports.</p><p>So with the \"Sweet 16\" now set, it's time for everyone to regroup. Maybe the team you picked to win it all is still in the tournament. Michigan State and defending champions Louisville, for instance, were popular picks before the tournament began and they're still playing. So are three of the regional No. 1 seeds: Florida, Arizona and Virginia. What's more, Kentucky was a preseason favorite of many fans to end up with the trophy, and the Wildcats seem to be playing some of their best basketball right now.</p><p>Give us your pick from among the 16 teams that are left.
