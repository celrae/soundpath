So much so, that long-held cultural assumptions are starting to change.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sheikh Mosa is chief of one of the villages, Mposa. He says there’s been a massive shift in mindset toward family planning as people in the villages begin to feel the effects of population growth and climate change first-hand.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Look no further than the recent flooding in Malawi that has washed away many of his people’s crops. Devastating floods in January displaced nearly a quarter million people, and half the country became an official disaster zone.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-image_on_right\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/eaton2_0.jpg?itok=vRXfhDK4\" alt=\"\" /><div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p>Women from the Mchilima Mothers Support Group in Mposa sing songs about the importance of family planning. The group was formed in 2012 in response to an increase in child marriages and school dropouts among girls, a trend they hope to reverse by promoting smaller family sizes.</p>\n  </div>\n  <span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Sam Eaton</p>\n  </div>\n</div>Mosa says the larger families in his village are struggling with hunger. With less food, kids drop out of school. Young girls may be forced into marriage or prostitution. But families with fewer children, he says, will find it easier to recover. \n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mosa says the struggles the villagers face today take precedence over any cultural or religious resistance to family planning. Even so, as a religious leader, he sees little conflict with Islam. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He notes the Koran says women should breastfeed for two years to encourage child spacing. So modern contraceptive methods, he argues, are \"really in line with what God commanded us to do.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mosa’s village has been leading the family planning push in this part of Malawi. It formed a mother’s support group that spreads the message of modern contraception and smaller family sizes through words and song. The group also rescues girls from child marriage and teenage pregnancy, ensuring they stay in school — all without a penny of outside financial support.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They’re doing this not because someone is telling them to, or paying them to, but because, as Mosa says, their future depends on it.</p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_border cta_align-left cta_icon-engagement cta_bg-gray\" data-entity-id=\"78130\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-78130\" class=\"node node-story-act contextual-links-region story-act-cta story-act-nid-78130 cta-type-newsletter cta-style-contribute clearfix\" about=\"/node/78130\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/78130\">Story Act Newsletter</a></h2>\n<div class=\"contextual-links-wrapper\">\n<ul class=\"contextual-links\"><li class=\"node-edit first\"><a href=\"/node/78130/edit?destination=node/77191/edit\">Edit</a></li>\n<li class=\"node-delete last\"><a href=\"/node/78130/delete?destination=node/77191/edit\">Delete</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p><span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Story Act Newsletter\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    Follow Across Women's LIves  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-image\">\n    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/awl_logo3_0.png?itok=H2miuTFb\" width=\"100\" height=\"63\" /></div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-teaser\">\n    Receive weekly email updates  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sosten Chiotha, Southern Africa regional director for the sustainable development NGO, <a href=\"http://www.lead.org\">LEAD</a>, says climate change and population growth in Malawi are not separate issues.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“I think maybe 20 years ago, they may not have been interested in these linkages because the population was low ... the land was still fertile, there were still a lot of forests. So I think there was not so much pressure then to try and understand. But now they do understand,” he says.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The problem, Chiotha says, is that Malawi's people lack access to family planning services. Malawi is a country that, for the three decades leading up to the mid 1990s, banned not only birth control but sex education and even miniskirts, thanks to the conservative beliefs of then-president Hastings Banda.</p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_no_border cta_align-right cta_no-icon cta_bg-white\" data-entity-id=\"78170\" data-entity-title=\" Poll Malawi AWL\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-78170\" class=\"node node-story-act contextual-links-region story-act-cta story-act-nid-78170 cta-type-custom-text clearfix\" about=\"/node/78170\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/78170\">Story Act: Poll Malawi AWL</a></h2>\n<div class=\"contextual-links-wrapper\">\n<ul class=\"contextual-links\"><li class=\"node-edit first\"><a href=\"/node/78170/edit?destination=node/77191/edit\">Edit</a></li>\n<li class=\"node-delete last\"><a href=\"/node/78170/delete?destination=node/77191/edit\">Delete</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p><span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Story Act: Poll Malawi AWL\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-body\">\n<div class=\"nochop\">\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12Td_s25qrM1k5WemTWe1g0GCKaCVYql4kyxK84Z2Eek/viewform?embedded=true\" width=\"760\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading...</iframe></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/IB-Malawi.pdf\">Guttmacher Institute</a>, a reproductive health organization, more than four out of every ten women in Malawi lack access to modern contraception. Closing that gap has become a rallying cry for the southern Malawi villages of Ncheo and Mposa.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A local Chanco Community Radio program recently aired a discussion between the two villages. People talked about how the majority of women are opting for injectable forms of contraception, since they last longer. To get the injection, the women have to walk for up to a day to reach clinics. And demand is so high that the clinics say they don't have enough contraception to go around.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The radio conversation shifted to teenage girls. Someone asked about providing birth control to adolescent girls as a way of preventing the teenage pregnancies and early marriages that are common in the two villages.  </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was an awkward moment on Chanco Community Radio. Girls between the age of 15 and 19 represent one of the highest overall unmet needs for family planning in Malawi. Pregnancy among unmarried teens has been on the rise in recent years.</p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_border cta_align-right cta_icon-engagement cta_bg-gray\" data-entity-id=\"77197\" data-entity-title=\" Malawi community radio\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-77197\" class=\"node node-story-act contextual-links-region story-act-cta story-act-nid-77197 cta-type-external-link cta-style-contribute clearfix\" about=\"/node/77197\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/77197\">Story Act: Malawi community radio</a></h2>\n<div class=\"contextual-links-wrapper\">\n<ul class=\"contextual-links\"><li class=\"node-edit first\"><a href=\"/node/77197/edit?destination=node/77191/edit\">Edit</a></li>\n<li class=\"node-delete last\"><a href=\"/node/77197/delete?destination=node/77191/edit\">Delete</a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<p><span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Story Act: Malawi community radio\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    Starting the conversation  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-image\">\n    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/chancoimage.jpg?itok=8gzSKCZ7\" width=\"100\" height=\"80\" /></div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-teaser\">\n    A community radio station in Malawi is tackling once taboo subjects like contraception and sex education.

But sex outside of marriage is still considered taboo in rural areas, especially for teens, who are instead taught about abstinence.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So it’s not exactly surprising that the radio audience concluded that giving young girls family planning would only encourage them to engage in sex.
