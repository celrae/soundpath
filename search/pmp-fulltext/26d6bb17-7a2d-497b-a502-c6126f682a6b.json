It was modeled on a similar program for Iraqi interpreters.

Many Afghans spent years in limbo, often in hiding from the Taliban. Many had their applications rejected for unspecified reasons and could not appeal. After a series of reforms in 2013, the process has improved, and now more than 15,000 Afghans and their families have relocated to the U.S. and have green cards.</p><p>But, as difficult as it is for Afghans to get visas to the U.S., that might actually be the easy part.
