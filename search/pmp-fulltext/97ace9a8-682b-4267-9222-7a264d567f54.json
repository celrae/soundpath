Every answer is the name of a country. For each word given, ignore the vowels. The consonants, in order from left to right, are the same consonants in the same order as in the country. For example, given the word \"omelet,\" the answer is \"Malta.\"</p><p><strong>Last week's challenge:</strong> This challenge came from listener Rudy Simons of Southfield, Mich. The letters of the one-syllable word \"groan\" can be rearranged to spell \"organ,\" which has two syllables. The challenge: Think of a common one-syllable, five-letter word whose letters can be rearranged to spell a common two-syllable word â€” and then rearranged again to spell a common three-syllable word.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Aides, aside, ideas OR aimed, amide, media.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> Joe Martin of San Francisco</p><p><strong>Next week's challenge: </strong>This is a spinoff of the on-air puzzle. Name a country with at least three consonants. These are the same consonants, in the same order, as in the name of a language spoken by millions of people worldwide. The country and the place where the language is principally spoken are in different parts of the globe. What country and what language are these?</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://help.npr.org/npr/includes/customer/npr/custforms/contactus.aspx?pz=t\">Submit Your Answer</a></strong><strong></strong></p><p>If you know the answer to next week's challenge, submit it <a href=\"http://help.npr.org/npr/includes/customer/npr/custforms/contactus.aspx?pz=t\">here</a>.
