But as the number of users rise to one-third of the world&#8217;s population, so rises the number of smartphones stolen and traded on the black market.</p><p>It is a multibillion dollar industry growing increasingly complicated as security analysts look for answers and black market entrepreneurs work to stay ahead of the curve.</p><p><a href=\"https://hereandnow.wbur.org/\"><em>Here & Now&#8217;</em></a>s Lisa Mullins spoke with journalist <strong>Matthew Shaer</strong>, who said that while Americans are aware of individual smartphone theft, often called &#8220;apple-picking,&#8221; they are less informed about larger scale operations, which can be even more profitable.</p><p>According to Shaer, there are two major other categories. In the first, known as a &#8220;smash and grab,&#8221; thieves take whole packages of not-yet-activated phones from vendors.</p><p>&#8220;Those smartphones, because they haven&#8217;t been activated yet are worth an incredible amount of money, especially if they can be shipped overseas,&#8221; Shaer said.</p><p>The second &#8212; called &#8220;credit muling&#8221; &#8212; is more complicated. Thieves pay residents of homeless shelters or halfway houses cash to sign up for a smartphone and then hand it over. Through hundreds of these transactions, each of which ruined the credit of the &#8220;mule,&#8221; one Sacramento couple was pulling in $2.5 million per year, Shaer said.</p><p>Anti-theft technology installed in new smartphones, such as the &#8220;kill switch,&#8221; <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/06/20/kill-switch-theft\" target=\"_blank\">has reduced theft by up to 30 percent in some areas</a>. But these updates mostly affect &#8220;apple picking,&#8221; rather than &#8220;smash and grab&#8221; or &#8220;credit muling.&#8221; In fact, according to Shaer, there&#8217;s been an increase in the other two types, which is why he&#8217;s not encouraged by new legislation that will require all smartphone manufacturers to install anti-theft measures by mid-2015.</p><p>&#8220;You make it harder for people to steal phones one way,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they&#8217;re just going to steal them another way.&#8221;</p><ul><li><strong>WIRED:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/12/where-stolen-smart-phones-go/\" target=\"_blank\">The Secret World of Stolen Smartphones, Where Business Is Booming</a></li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.matthewshaer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Shaer</a></strong>, journalist who has written for GQ, New York Magazine, Harper&#8217;s, and more.
