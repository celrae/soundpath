Just hours after attacks, Wasfi <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tyDtGAGoqI\">can be seen</a> seated amid ash and rubble in a black suit jacket, long hair combed back, playing his cello. For him, this combination of music and place has become a form of resistance, something he told <em>Morning Edition</em> when the show reached him at home in Baghdad.</p><p>\"This was an action respecting the souls and the spirits of the fallen ones due to terror around the world â€” and, of course, Baghdad, because we're living the reality over here,\" Wasfi says. \"The other side chose to turn every element, every aspect of life in Iraq into a battle and into a war zone. I chose to turn every corner of Iraq into a spot for civility, beauty and compassion.\"</p><p><strong></strong>Wasfi resides in a well-to-do neighborhood of Baghdad called Mansour, once an enclave of diplomats and private clubs. A deadly attack in Mansour a few weeks ago, an explosion Wasfi narrowly missed, prompted him to take his cello to the streets.</p><p>Wasfi's close friend Ammar al-Shahbander posted footage of that first performance, in which he performs an original composition titled \"Baghdad Mourning Melancholy.\" In the video, a man in a wheelchair rolls up slowly right next to Wasfi, taking in the unusual moment, while others gather to watch and listen.</p><p>\"Some soldiers were in tears, some shop owners were in tears. Some people were confused,\" Wasfi remembers. \"I was connecting everything: death, spirits, bodies, life. People were supportive. They were appreciating the fact that someone can still at least lead their emotions and spirits towards something beautiful, to rise above the intimidation of improvised death.\"</p><p>The video went viral, broadcasting Wasfi's music and message beyond Iraq. His next performance came after a tragedy that affected him personally, when al-Shahbander was himself killed by a car bomb attack.<strong> </strong>The next morning, Wasfi put on a full white suit and grabbed his cello again.</p><p>\"Unlike what people think, we have a choice of fighting back,\" Wasfi says. \"We can't just surrender to the impending doom of uncertainty by not functioning. But I think it's an awakening for everybody to make a choice and to choose how they want to live, not how they want to die.\"  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
