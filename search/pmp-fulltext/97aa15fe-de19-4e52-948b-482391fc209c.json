I didn't know what it was filled with, but it spilled a bit. And it was gasoline.\"</p><p>Moore's next-door neighbor was one of the boys in the group. \"He emptied the gasoline on me,\" Moore says. \"I recall him attempting to light a match and it just wouldn't light. That happened about three times.\"</p><p>Moore's aunt came outside before the boys managed to light the match. \"I just remember my aunt dragging me to the local hospital with gasoline in my eyes,\" Moore says. \"And I smelled like that for, like, 24 hours.\"</p><p>But Moore says he wasn't angry — just embarrassed. \"I was picked on in front of teachers, in front of adults, on streets, so I was used to it,\" he says. \"And I don't know why it took me until adulthood to actually get in my head that that was literally somebody trying to end my life.\"</p><p>When Epps asks if he knows where those attackers are now, Moore says no.</p><p>\"I tried to search for the one neighbor in particular who poured the gasoline on me,\" he says. \"And it's so funny, you know, in recalling the story, even while the other guys were punching me, I was only focused on him — because, I think, I've always wanted his friendship. I just never imagined that a kid who knows your name who lives in the same neighborhood with you would want to do something like that.\"</p><p>\"I wish I could have asked, 'Why would you want to light me on fire?' What did I do to him to make him want to do that?\"</p><p><em>Audio produced for </em>Weekend Edition Sunday<em> by Nadia Reiman.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
