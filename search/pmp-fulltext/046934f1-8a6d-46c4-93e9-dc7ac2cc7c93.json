The British pop singer (born Charlotte Aitchison) sang the vocal hook in the de facto song of the summer, Iggy Azalea's \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-zpOMYRi0w\" target=\"_blank\">Fancy</a>,\" while her own \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOPMlIIg_38\" target=\"_blank\">Boom Clap</a>\" single infused <em>The Fault In Our Stars</em>' soundtrack with slick star power.</p><p>She's particularly known for her collaborations — writing and appearing in Icona Pop's \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxxajLWwzqY\">I Love It</a>\" — and she's already looking ahead, with some co-written songs scheduled to appear on the new <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15397010/gwen-stefani\">Gwen Stefani</a> record. But Charli XCX's second album, <em>Sucker</em>, comes out Tuesday, and her name is the only one on it. It's a boisterous punk-pop mix, full of snark and rebellion.</p><p>Charli XCX recently spoke to NPR's Rachel Martin about dumb pop songs, <em>Sucker</em>'s punk genesis, and the idea that \"People always expect me to be a really bitchy, horrible person, but I'm just super-chill and un-diva-ish.\"</p><hr /><h3>Interview Highlights</h3><p><strong>On being an anti-pop star</strong></p><p>I make pop music, but I do it on my own terms. I'll never play the game, so to speak, just for success. I'll always follow my heart and make the music I want to make.</p><p><strong>On <em>Sucker</em>'s noisier beginnings</strong></p><p>It was never a plan; I just ended up making a lot of punk songs. I just wanted to not make pop music for a while. Because I felt like I got so caught up in my brain, trying to write hits, that it became super-unenjoyable for me. It felt like I was trying to become a machine.</p><p>So I went to Stockholm and wrote loads of two-minute songs where I just sort of screamed into a microphone for ages. That eventually led me to being able to write some pop music again.</p><p><strong>On being named executive producer of <em>Sucker</em></strong></p><p>It was always important to me that I was recognized for doing that, because there's such a huge misconception about women in the industry and how we're all supposedly puppets. I just wanted to make it clear that's definitely not the case with me.</p><p>I just enjoy making music. I want my music, whether it's sung by other people or sung by myself, to affect the way the Top 40 radio sounds. I want to heavily influence it with things that have come directly from my brain.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
