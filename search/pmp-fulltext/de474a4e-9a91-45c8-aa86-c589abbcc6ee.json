You know, 'It's time for a bowl of posole to get me right,' \" he says.</p><p>He calls the stew comfort food with a little spice to it. \"It makes you feel good, you sweat a little bit from the chilies; [it] gets all those impurities out,\" he says.</p><p>Lamas shared his recipe for <em>All Things Considered</em>'s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/175306271/found-recipes\" target=\"_blank\">Found Recipes</a> series but says posole is infinitely customizable.

Roast at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes and then remove from oven.</p><p>Add 1/2 gallon chicken stock, cover and put back in the oven at 250 degrees for 6 hours until fork-tender (this step can be done ahead of time). Use two forks to pull pork into chunks — not shredded, but broken into bite-size pieces. Reserve pan juices.</p><p>Boil hominy in salted water until tender, then drain. If using canned hominy, drain and rinse. Peel and dice the tomatillos.</p><p>In a large stockpot, saute the onions and tomatillos in 2 ounces oil for 3 minutes until softened, then add the remaining garlic.</p><p>In a separate bowl, mash the whole peeled tomatoes. Add tomatoes to the onion mixture, and add remaining ingredients to pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 30 minutes, then turn off the heat. Add the pork and reserved juices to the pot of broth.</p><p>This soup can be made up to five days ahead of time and refrigerated.</p><p>Serve with warm tortillas, chopped cabbage, diced raw onion, lime wedges and fresh cilantro.</p><p><em>Recipe courtesy of Anthony Lamas</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
