Not to be out-catchied, Bob retaliates with <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/230132542/rubblebucket\">Rubblebucket</a>'s \"Carousel Ride,\" from the band's upcoming release <em>Survival Sounds</em>. Full of explosive synthesizers and melodies made to climb the charts, it gives Robin a run for his money.</p><p>Bob also plays <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15979487/brian-eno\">Brian Eno</a> and Karl Hyde's trance-inducing \"DBF,\" from the pair's recent LP, <em>High Life, </em>and follows that with the gentler yet equally hypnotic \"Lonestar,\" by the Baltimore duo Peals (which is led by members of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/126609595/future-islands\">Future Islands</a> and Double Dagger). Keeping the peaceful mood going, Robin plays \"The First Time,\" the tranquil opening track to singer-songwriter Matt Kivel's <em>Days of Being Wild</em>, released today.</p><p>Bob and Robin close out the show with <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15052810/coldplay\">Coldplay</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/15329979/cat-power\">Cat Power</a>'s unexpected collaboration \"Wish I Was Here,\" from the soundtrack of Zach Braff's upcoming film<em> </em>of the same name. After such a frenetic first half to the show, \"Wish I Was Here\" is the slow, soothing finale. When it's over, everyone is ready for a cuddly nap.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
