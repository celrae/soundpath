Roxbury used to be a rural farm town, but wealthy people seeking the quiet of rolling hills and country simplicity moved in. And when they moved in, the price to own a home moved up. Adding to that cost, says Prevost, were highly-restrictive zoning laws put in place by the local government to attract “the right kinds of people.” For instance, one zoning law considered by the town would require people to have a minimum lot size of four acres in the town.

As prices go up and restrictions become more onerous, Roxbury increasingly becomes a town for the rich only, says Prevost. The rich, and the old. Young families can’t afford to buy and there are no smaller, starter homes available in town because of zoning restrictions. The demographic shift in Roxbury isn’t limited to this single town, says Prevost. Connecticut has one of the oldest populations in the country with one of the lowest birthrates. Aging populations require younger people to fill out local tax bases and innovate new jobs into the economy.

We have lost a lot of that through suburbanization and as we see the deepening inequities between incomes, I think that’s reinforced by some of this zoning.”</p></div>","contenttemplated":"[{\"type\":\"text/html\",\"content\":\"<p>A &quot;snob zone&quot; is a place that uses restrictive zoning in a residential area to keep certain types of housing -- and therefore people -- out, says <a href=\\\"http://www.lisaprevost.com/\\\">Lisa Prevost</a>.
