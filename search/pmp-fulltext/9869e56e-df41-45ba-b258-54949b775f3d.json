Only in the 1930s, when the US made alcohol legal again, did the cartels switch over to smuggling illegal drugs.</p>\n<p>Camacho gained fame for playing narcocorridos in the <em>grupera</em> style, which Wald says is a specific type of Sinaloan music. “The classic, old-fashioned sound everywhere was just guitars and singers, and the classic Sinoalan sound is brass bands.”</p>\n<p>Los Plebes del Rancho consisted of just two guitar players and a tuba player. Camacho played the <em>requinto</em>, a<em> </em>12-string guitar. Wald says the band pays homage to another band, El Canelo y Los Dos del Sitio, that first started the trend of playing with just two guitars and a tuba about 15 years ago.</p>\n<p>“I thought it was going to be a one-off novelty, but it actually caught on,” he says.</p>\n<p>While Camacho gained fame for singing narcocorridos, he also had a reputation as a crooner. One of his biggest hits, “Hablemos,” is a love song.</p>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bN3G5gXKPkY\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n<p>“He was only 22 years old, he’s a good looking, young guy, and he really had a romantic appeal and that’s a big deal,\" Wald says. \"Narcocorridos, like gangster rap, has mostly been a boys' style, but he’s clearly been a guy who appealed to young women.”</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Camacho left a now-final video message to his fans on his Facebook page. \"I want invite all my beautiful people in Chihuahua to come see us on March 13th in Santa Rita,\" he wrote. \"I'll be expecting all of my people there, especially all the beautiful girls. Here's a kiss to all of them!”</p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-02-27%2Fremembering-ariel-camacho-22-year-old-mexican-singer-narcocorridos&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/pris-world/segment-audio/0227201503.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0227201503mp3"}]}
