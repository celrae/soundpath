When too many of the jobs are in that sector, that can be problematic as well.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.soc.washington.edu/faculty-details/crutch\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Crutchfield</a></strong>, professor of sociology at the University of Washington, and author of the book,Â &#8220;Get a Job: Labor Markets, Economic Opportunity, and Crime.&#8221;</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
