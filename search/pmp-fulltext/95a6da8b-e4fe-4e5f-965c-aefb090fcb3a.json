In the 1930s, his grandfather, Auguste, was the first to balloon into the stratosphere.</p><p>Thirty years later, Auguste's son, Jacques, was on the first team to reach the Mariana Trench, the deepest point of the ocean.</p><p>Then in 1999, Bertrand and his co-pilot completed the first nonstop circumnavigation of the globe by balloon, flying nearly 28,000 miles in 20 days.</p><p>Now, a team of scientists and engineers around Piccard and co-pilot Andr√© Borschberg is building Solar Impulse, an aircraft powered by solar energy. The prototype has the weight of a car but the wingspan of an airbus.</p><p>Solar Impulse has successfully flown from Spain to Morocco and across the United States. The next mission: circumnavigation.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
