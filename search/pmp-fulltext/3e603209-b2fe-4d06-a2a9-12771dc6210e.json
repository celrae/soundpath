Obama invoked the Constitution&#8217;s provision giving the president the power to make temporary appointments when the Senate is in recess.</p><p>Problem is, the court said, the Senate was not actually in a formal recess when Obama acted.</p><p><strong>Abortion clinic buffer zones</strong></p><p>The Supreme Court has struck down a 35-foot protest-free zone outside abortion clinics in Massachusetts. The justices were unanimous Thursday that extending a buffer zone 35 feet from clinic entrances violates the First Amendment rights of protesters.</p><p>Chief Justice John Roberts says authorities have less intrusive ways to deal with problems outside the clinics.</p><p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting to this article.</em></p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://emilybazelon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Emily Bazelon</a></strong>, senior editor at <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/authors.emily_bazelon.html\" target=\"_blank\">Slate</a> and senior research fellow at <a href=\"http://www.law.yale.edu/faculty/EBazelon.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Yale Law School</a>.
