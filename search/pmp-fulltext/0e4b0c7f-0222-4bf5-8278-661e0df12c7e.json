But NPR TV critic Eric Deggans says the show works best when focused on the black family at its core.","itags":["npr_api","375543991"],"guid":"0e4b0c7f-0222-4bf5-8278-661e0df12c7e","contentencoded":"<p>At times, Fox's new hip-hop centered family drama <em>Empire</em> feels like <em>Dynasty</em> by way of Jay-Z and Beyonce — or <em>Glee</em> with a beat.</p><p>Especially during scenes like the moment that pops up early in Wednesday night's debut episode, when two brothers improvise a song together during a house party that winds up sounding like it was pieced together over weeks in a Los Angeles recording studio.</p><p>Credit musical director and hit hip-hop producer Timbaland for spicing up <em>Empire</em> with head-turning tracks that actually sound like they could be big radio hits.</p><p>Unfortunately, the show's plot is a little less original: Terrence Howard plays Lucious Lyon, a rapper-turned-music mogul with three sons; secretly stricken with a serious disease, he wants to groom an heir as their company goes public.</p><p>\"It can only be one of you,\" Lucious tells his boys during a family meeting.</p><p>\"What is this?\" says one of them. \"We <em>King Lear</em> now?\"</p><p>Lucious responds with anger: \"Call it what you want, smartass. ... In order for it to survive, I need one of you Negroes to man up and lead it!\"</p><p>Less <em>King Lear</em> than <em>The Godfather</em>, this succession fight features three sons who seem little more than stereotypes: the clean-cut son with a white girlfriend, trying to prove he's really black; the gay son whose dad won't accept his sexual orientation; and the volatile hip-hop star with more style than good sense.</p><p>Fortunately, this show has an ace in the hole.</p><p>Oscar nominee Taraji P. Henson eats up the scenery on this show as Lucious' ex-wife Cookie. She's steely, streetwise and savvy about the music industry. But she took a fall for Lucious, going to jail for 17 years so he could use $400,000 in drug money to start their company.</p><p>As the show begins, she's fresh out of the slammer and threatening to derail everything if she can't manage her son's career.</p><p>\"I've been living like a dog for 17 years, and now ... I want what's mine,\" she tells Lucious while plunking on a piano in his office. \"I want Jamal.\"</p><p>This sets up one of many conflicts on the show, as Cookie takes over managing their gay son, Jamal, and Lucious backs in-your-face rapper son Hakeem. Clean-cut son Andre has subtly encouraged this — egged on by his white girlfriend — in hopes that his two other brothers will destroy each other.</p><p>It's safe to say network TV has never built a show around a black family quite like this. And that challenge inspired co-creator Lee Daniels.</p><p>\"There just hadn't been any African-American television that I respected ... or hadn't been for a long time,\" he said in a behind-the-scenes program about the series. \"And I thought, what a way to come and give you a provocative sort of look at a family in the hip-hop world.\"</p><p>Some things don't work here. There are so many storylines, the pilot seems overfilled with high drama. And positioning the white girlfriend as a Machiavellian schemer with the duplicitous Andre seems a troubling and too-obvious knock at black men who dare to date Caucasian women.</p><p>But <em>Empire</em> really clicks when showcasing this wealthy black family that started out poor.</p><p>Lucious rides his sons hard. He tells one to \"take the bass out yo' voice when you talk to me,\" in an old-school rebuke to kids who dare to talk back.</p><p>And in a flashback scene to when Jamal was a young child, we see Lucious spot him wearing women's shoes and attack him, trying to dump him in a trash can.</p><p>But Cookie stops her husband, comforting Jamal. The incident resembles a story Daniels told about his own childhood during <a href=\"http://www.out.com/out-exclusives/out100-2013/2013/11/13/out100-lee-daniels\">an interview </a>with <em>Out</em> magazine a few years ago, hinting at how personal some of these plotlines are.</p><p>Just like the films Daniels has directed, <em>The Butler</em> and <em>Precious</em>, <em>Empire</em> soars highest when probing the conflicts and contradictions of the black family, making high drama out of the dysfunction lying just beneath the surface.</p><p><em>Empire debuts at 9 p.m. EST Jan. 7 on Fox.</em>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
