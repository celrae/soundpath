Don&#8217;t do this if you can&#8217;t afford to pay it off by the next billing cycle.</li><li><strong>Keep your credit card spending to less than 30 percent</strong> of your available credit card balance. Spending more than 30 percent can bring down your credit score.</li><li><strong>Sign up for loyalty cards at your favorite stores</strong>, and get their email newsletters, which often include early information on sales and deals.</li><li><strong>Don&#8217;t go to the mall if you don&#8217;t have a plan.</strong> The music and smells of food are designed to keep you there longer so you spend more. Shop online instead.</li><li><strong>An app called &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.shopadvisor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shop Advisor</a>&#8220;</strong> keeps track of the products you want to buy and alerts you when the price drops.</li><li><strong>The &#8220;<a href=\"http://redlaser.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Red Laser</a>&#8221; app</strong> lets you scan a barcode, and it finds the best price online or at a particular store in your area.</li></ul><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.michellesingletary.com/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle Singletary</a></strong>, writes the nationally syndicated personal finance column, “<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/newssearch/?query=%22color+of+money%22\" target=\"_blank\">The Color of Money</a>” for The Washington Post.
