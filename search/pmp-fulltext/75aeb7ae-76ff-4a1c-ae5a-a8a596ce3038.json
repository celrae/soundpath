It's so far east, in fact, that it's actually the only part of Russia that crosses the International Date Line into the Western Hemisphere. It may be remote, but it's a perfect place for a test of traditional hunting and survival skills among Artic peoples.</p>\n<p>“When we start competing, it’s just the same as competing at home,” said Johnny Issaluk, who came from Canada's Baffin Island this summer to compete in the first ever <a href=\"http://beringiagames.com/\">Beringia Arctic Games</a>. “There’s nothing different. I am playing with my homeboys.\"</p>\n<p>The games brought athletes from seven Arctic nations — including Canada, Norway, the United States, Iceland and Greenland — to Russia for events like boat races, wrestling and local events that the competitors taught each other. The Russian government is hoping to make it an annual event that will draw tourists to the area.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"2136\" width=\"3216\" alt=\"A Russian man competes in the one arm reach in the village of Novo Chaplino, where the games were hosted.

His research focuses on the native people of Russia’s Far East.</p>\n<p>​The disconnect isn’t just about kids growing up and moving away: There’s big money to be made here in mining valuable metals and exploring for oil and gas. </p>\n<p>“A lot of that kind of information about subsurface resources — oil, minerals and whatnot — can sometimes be classified as state secrets in Russia,” King said. “People are less able to know their landscape in an intimate way than their grandparents knew it, and those are skills that either take a lifetime to recover — or may be unrecoverable.\"</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"media media-element-container media-default\"><img height=\"2136\" width=\"3216\" style=\"line-height: 20.0063px;\" alt=\"A village elder enjoys some of the singing and drumming during a break from the athletic events.\" title=\"A village elder enjoys some of the singing and drumming during a break from the athletic events.\" class=\"media-element file-default\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.pri.org/sites/default/files/DSC_3039.JPG\" /><span class=\"field-label\">\n    Credit:\n  </span>\n\n  <div class=\"field-credit inline\">\n    <p>Emily Schwing</p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"field-caption\">\n    <p class=\"Body\">A village elder enjoys some of the singing and drumming during a break from the athletic events.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>No one know this better than Olga Letykai, who works as a liaison between the Russian government and local marine mammal hunters.
