Kudrow would have received 40 percent for the first re-run (40 percent of $2,500 = $1,000), 30 percent for the second re-run ($750) and then 25 percent for the next three re-runs. After that, it goes down incrementally until the 13th time it airs. &nbsp;From then on, an actor gets 5 percent for each episode every time it airs, forever. So if “The One Where Eddie Moves In” re-aired five times in syndication, the math would work like this:\n<div class=\"large blue awesome\">40% of $2,500 = $1,000</div>\n&nbsp;\n<p><strong>+</strong></p>\n<div class=\"large blue awesome\">30% of $2,500 = $750</div>\n&nbsp;\n<p><strong>+</strong></p>\n<div class=\"large blue awesome\">25% of $2,500 = $625 x 3 = $1,875</div>\n&nbsp;\n<p>Kudrow would also be compensated for foreign rights, but those work a little differently.
