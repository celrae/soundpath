No TV or video games. No texting. Just a bunch of songs and some great conversations about what you love, or don't love and why.</p><p>It's kind of a fantasy — a nice idea that almost never really happens — but for the past few years, <em>All Songs Considered </em>has been hosting listening parties that get pretty close to that fantasy. We fill a club or auditorium with music lovers. We have a panel of two or three guests on stage: some friends, some colleagues, maybe a musician or two. And we play songs. Everyone in the room, on stage and off, has a stack of cards numbered 1 through 10. And as we listen, everyone rates the music. A \"1\" means you pretty much hate the song and a \"10\" means you're over-the-moon in love with it. And then we talk about the songs. It gets heated sometimes.</p><p>We recently hosted a listening party in Washington, D.C, with Bob on stage and Robin in the audience. Three guests sit on the panel — NPR Music's Stephen Thompson, Katie Alice Greer (singer for the D.C. band <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/artists/239140258/priests\" target=\"_blank\">Priests</a>) and Emily White, who runs the artists management company <a href=\"http://whitesmithentertainment.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Whitesmith Entertainment</a>. Everybody brought songs to share with the audience, but we began with one of Bob's picks, a song that should be familiar to regular <em>All Songs </em>listeners.</p><p>You can hear the entire listening party with the link above, or just the songs featured below.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
