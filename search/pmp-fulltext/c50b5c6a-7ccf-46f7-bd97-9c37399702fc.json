We’re here to help them out any way we can.”</p>\n<p>One of the students, Shailesh Thapa, is a senior from Nepal, majoring in biotech. His home town of Bhaktapur was badly damaged. His mother, father and brother are OK, but he hasn’t heard from many of the friends he grew up with.</p>\n<p>“I got a call from one of my friends,” Thapa says. “His house fell down; his two younger sisters got trapped under the house and they were yelling for help until yesterday, but today they can't hear them anymore. They’ve been trying to get them out, but the house itself was so buried. It's really hard to get those little kids out from there, and they haven't heard from them now, and I'm just hoping that they're alive.”</p>\n<p>Another student, Parmita Gurung, left Nepal for the US when she was 8. She still has vivid memories of her childhood there and strong connections to her homeland. Her relatives are living outside, under the trees, for now.</p>\n<p>“I was at work the other day and I got a phone call from my uncle,” she says. “He told me not to worry and then he passed the phone to my grandmother. She started talking to me and I could tell she was trying to tell me not to cry so much, that everything was going to be fine, but I could feel the tremor in her voice and I just broke down crying.”</p>\n<p>Other students have similarly emotional stories. Everyone's immediate family members are OK, but that doesn't mean their futures are secure. </p>\n<div class=\"edit-entity cta_no_border cta_align-right cta_icon-engagement cta_bg-white\" data-entity-id=\"79704\" data-entity-title=\" Facebook event Helping Nepal\" data-entity-type=\"node\">\n<div id=\"node-79704\" class=\"node node-story-act story-act-cta story-act-nid-79704 cta-type-external-link cta-style-suggest clearfix\" about=\"/node/79704\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\">\n<h2><a href=\"/node/79704\">Story Act: Facebook event Helping Nepal</a></h2>\n<p>    <span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Story Act: Facebook event Helping Nepal\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span><span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"field-display-title\">\n    How can I help?  </div>\n<div class=\"field-story-act-teaser\">\n    Many of you have been impacted by the earthquake that has rocked Nepal and surrounding areas.

He says he could tell his uncle was trying to sound optimistic so he, Gurung, wouldn't worry, but it didn't work because Gurung could hear people screaming in the background. Still, he's moved by all the support he and his fellow Nepali students are getting on campus at UMass Boston. The students and staff who came to the emergency meeting spent an hour brainstorming how to raise funds and let people know about the earthquake.</p>\n<p>“It's really great to hear a lot of positive ideas,” Gurung says. “The more people there are, the more ideas we get rolling, and everyone knows something that you don't know.”</p>\n<p>Some of the ideas students came up with include making sure money goes to bona fide charities and not scams, asking professors for time to speak about the earthquake for a couple of minutes at the beginning of each class, handing out information cards with links for donations, and telling personal stories so people here in the US can relate to the tragedy.</p>\n<p>As they speak, the Nepali students veer from pragmatic to heartbroken and back again. They are grieving hard, longing for a homeland they fear will never be the same. In the short term they plan to cope by raising as much money for Nepal as they possibly can.</p>\n<p><img id=\"pri-insights\" src=\"http://api.pri.org/insights/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pri.org%2Fstories%2F2015-04-28%2Fnepali-students-boston-channel-their-grief-fundraising-efforts-earthquake-relief&amp;feed=pmp\" /></p>\n<br><p>From PRI's The World ©2015 <a href=\"http://www.pri.org\">Public Radio International</a></p>\n","audio":[{"href":"http://pri-113a.kxcdn.com/sites/default/files/story/images/IMG_5623.JPG","meta":{"crop":"primary","height":null,"width":null},"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/img5623jpg"},{"href":"http://cdn.pri.org/sites/default/files/segment-audio/04282015_02.mp3"},{"href":"http://www.pri.org/file/0428201502mp3"}]}
