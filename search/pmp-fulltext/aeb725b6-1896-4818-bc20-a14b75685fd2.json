And so, as were standing in this huddle around the dead deer, my father said make sure your chambers are clear. Make sure your gun is empty. I &#8212; assuming that it completely was &#8212; pointed it off to my side, not down to the ground as one should, and pulled the trigger. And instead, it in fact had not shot. And it hit my brother who was standing right next to me. He fell dead.&#8221;</p><p><strong>On dealing with the emotional aftermath of a tragic accident</strong></p><p>“Silence can happen, does happen. Isolation, guilt, fear, shame &#8212; how do you respond? How do you respond to the suffering, that’s not just come down on the person who has caused that accident, but the people around them who also feel completely responsible?</p><p>&#8220;Silence isn’t the answer, but I also know, oddly, that premature consolation is not the answer either.”</p><p><strong>On how he survived the tragedy and moved on</strong></p><p>“I’m on record as believing that poetry saved me. I was so isolated that for me poetry became a way of expressing what was in me, trying to make sense of it. What’s beautiful about poetry is that it asks that you turn the world into words. Turn everything that’s inside you into words and then it says, &#8216;Look, we’re going to really organize these words. We’re going to try and make them fit on a single page.&#8217;”</p><p>“Every poem to me is an affirmation of being in the world. It’s a way of saying life has meaning. Here are these words that are trying to sing.”</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://www.engl.virginia.edu/people/gso\">Gregory Orr</a>, </strong>poet and professor of English at the University of Virginia.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
