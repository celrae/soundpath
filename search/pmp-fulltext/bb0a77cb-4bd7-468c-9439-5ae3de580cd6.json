So the set, we really needed it to be the all-American sort of generic sitcom set. You know, with the living room and stairway going up to the upstairs which we never see.&#8221;</p><p><div class=\"l-article-primary pullquote\" style=\"\"></p><p>&#8220;I think it allows people to have access and deal with some of these issues in a way that they couldn&#8217;t if it was just a regular news story.&#8221;<div class=\"pullquoteauth\">&ndash; Aasif Mandvi</div></p><p></div></p><p><strong>Miles on the fake laugh track</strong></p><p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s kind of key. That&#8217;s what we know of those old multi-camera sitcoms. It was the cue for the audience when to laugh. It was always a little bit overdone in the &#8217;80s and late &#8217;80s. We screened it occasionally and someone would be like, &#8216;I didn&#8217;t need the laugh track, I knew where to laugh.&#8217; For me, it&#8217;s part of the parody of it. If you don&#8217;t get that it&#8217;s a parody of that format then maybe you won&#8217;t like the laugh track.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Aasif on Barry West&#8217;s Facebook post</strong></p><p>&#8220;The whole joke was that my character is trying to teach this girl how to be a better bully because Aasif &#8211; the character Aasif on the show &#8211; gets offended by the fact that she&#8217;s calling his daughter a Sikh. So the idea is that if you&#8217;re gonna bully us then at least get the racial slur right, so that was the whole premise of that. It&#8217;s a great visual image to show that. And we blew it up and put it on an easel and stuff and showed it on camera. It&#8217;s very shocking and gets the point across really well.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s darkly funny. I mean, I think that&#8217;s the whole thing about the show, is that we have things that are kind of serious, but using this format, I think it allows people to have access and deal with some of these issues in a way that they couldn&#8217;t if it was just a regular news story.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0D1dPPl8sY\">[Youtube]</a></p><h4>Guests</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://halalinthefamily.tv/aasif/\" target=\"_blank\">Aasif Mandvi</a>, </strong>writer,<strong> </strong>actor and<strong> </strong>co-creator of &#8220;Halal in the Family.&#8221; He tweets <a class=\"ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav\" href=\"https://twitter.com/aasif\" target=\"_blank\">@<span class=\"u-linkComplex-target\">aasif</span></a>.</li><li><strong><a href=\"http://mileskahn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Miles Kahn</a>, </strong>writer, producer, director and co-creator of &#8220;Halal in the Family.&#8221; He tweets <a class=\"ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav\" href=\"https://twitter.com/mileskahn\" target=\"_blank\">@<span class=\"u-linkComplex-target\">mileskahn</span></a>.</li></ul>  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
