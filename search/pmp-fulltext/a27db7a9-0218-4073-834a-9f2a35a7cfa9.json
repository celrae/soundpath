We&#8217;ve enforced it with a curfew center since 2008. I&#8217;m a little perplexed sometimes with the amount of controversy since it&#8217;s been something that&#8217;s been in place. We took away the penalty of jail &#8212; the previous curfew violators, the parents were at risk of jail. There was a penalty of jail. We took that out, and in its place put the fine. The city council put in place a measure that the fine could be waived if the parents participated in resource training or parenting classes. So, we reduced the penalty, we changed the curfew time so that a 6-year-old and a 16-year-old wouldn&#8217;t have the same curfew, and it seemed to be pretty common sense not controversial.&#8221;</p><p><strong>OnÂ why the curfew is important</strong></p><p>&#8220;The vast majority of people when we go out to the meetings are very supportive. People understand that we need to keep an eye on our kids and we have to watch out for them. We want to know if there are kids that are out there unsupervised, don&#8217;t know where their parents are, don&#8217;t have anyone that&#8217;s responsible for them. We want to know and we want to connect them with a responsible adult so they can be protected.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;When you have a child that&#8217;s out there unsupervised, late at night, there&#8217;s a problem. I want to get to the bottom of it and fix it so these kids are able to reach their fullest potential and we can have healthy families in Baltimore. I am fully committed to making sure that this is not a program that turns into a de facto stop-and-frisk, and I&#8217;m curious how it could be seen as demonizing children when the whole focus is on protecting our young people and making sure that they have an opportunity to grow. The data shows that this works &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing to support any of the red flags that have been thrown up.&#8221;</p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://mayor.baltimorecity.gov/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Stephanie Rawlings-Blake</strong></a>, mayor of Baltimore.
