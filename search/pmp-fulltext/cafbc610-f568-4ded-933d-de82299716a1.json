The additional time was given \"based on the uncertainty created\" by an ongoing legal battle in Nebraska, according to a State Department statement.</p><p>In February, a Nebraska judge <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/02/20/280182838/nebraska-to-appeal-ruling-that-blocks-keystone-pipeline-in-state\">struck down a 2012 law</a> that allowed part of the pipeline to run through the state. The pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf Coast.</p><p>Waiting for a final ruling in Nebraska could push a federal decision on the pipeline past the midterm elections in November, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/keystone-xl-pipeline-decision-delayed-105825.html\">Politico reports</a>. In its release Friday, the State Department did not say how much more time it would give agencies.</p><p>The State Department is also reviewing roughly 2.5 million public comments on the matter, NPR's Jackie Northam tells our Newscast.</p><p>The reaction to Friday's announcement was swift, NPR's Tamara Keith reports for <em>All Things Considered</em>. Republicans denounced the move as political. Manager Cindy Schild of the American Petroleum Institute, which backs the project, said the decision was sad and shocking.</p><p>\"It's just putting this delay in perpetuity when we could be putting Americans to work,\" she told Keith. \"Once again, we're looking at a sad day when we're seeing politics trumping good policy decision-making at the White House.\"</p><p>On the other side of the debate, environmentalist Bill McKibben said, \"We need more than delays, we need the president to act boldly and set a signal for the rest of the world that this is the kind of project that we just can't do going forward.\"</p><p>As It's All Politics has reported, the contested project <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2014/02/03/271113797/keystone-xl-pipeline-report-creates-political-headache-for-obama\">became even more complicated</a> after the State Department released an environmental assessment in January. The agency found that Canada's production of tar sands crude <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/01/31/269529696/state-dept-delivers-unwelcome-news-for-keystone-opponents\">was unlikely to be affected</a> by the pipeline.</p><p>Nebraskans are split over the issue, <a href=\"http://www.twincities.com/business/ci_25394862/keystone-xl-pipeline-project-still-divides-nebraska\">The Associated Press reported in March</a>, particularly as some landowners have already reached financial settlements with the pipeline company, TransCanada.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
