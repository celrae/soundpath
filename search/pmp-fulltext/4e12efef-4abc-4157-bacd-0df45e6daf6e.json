But he also implored Middle Eastern nations to take the lead in addressing the conditions that have sparked the rise of extremists, including cutting off funding to terror groups.</p><p>U.S. and Arab nations that have joined the U.S.-led coalition have confirmed airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria yesterday, the U.S. continued the strikes in Syria and Iraq today.</p><p><strong>Anthony Cordesman</strong>, a security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies told <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org\"><em>Here & Now&#8217;</em></a>s that it&#8217;s too soon to tell how effective the strikes have been.</p><p><strong>On the Efficacy of the Airstrikes</strong></p><p>&#8220;Some of these strikes have hit major facilities that are probably critical,&#8221; Cordesman said. &#8220;Others have been essentially to get one or two vehicles. And there&#8217;s been no overall assessment of what is happening, and quite frankly there can&#8217;t be. It takes at least several days to make that kind of damage assessment. But what is clear: these are really major efforts to stop the Islamic State.&#8221;</p><p><span style=\"color: #000000\"><div class=\"pullquote\" style=\"\"></span><span style=\"color: #000000\">This is a struggle that will take years.

In addition, Cordesman says the head of civil government in Turkey and Turkish security services and military are at odds.</p><p><strong>On the Future</strong></p><p>Ultimately, Cordesman says those involved and those watching need to realize this will be a protracted and complex fight.</p><p>&#8220;This is a struggle that will take years. We have to look beyond the Islamic State &#8212; important as it is &#8212;  and realize that this is an ideological battle,&#8221; Cordesman said. &#8220;We simply have to face the fact that this is incredibly complex, it involves a lot of risks. We&#8217;re going to have to change and innovate to make it work. Because the alternative isn&#8217;t simply a limited number of terrorist attacks in the U.S. or the West. It is watching the entire Middle East deteriorate and put a massive threat to the world&#8217;s major source of energy exports.&#8221;</p><p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting.</em></p><h4>Guest</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=\"http://csis.org/expert/anthony-h-cordesman\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony H.
