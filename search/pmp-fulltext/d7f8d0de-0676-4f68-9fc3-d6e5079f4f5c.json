Those who do have a much harder time getting divorced once they get back home.","itags":["npr_api","365690632"],"guid":"d7f8d0de-0676-4f68-9fc3-d6e5079f4f5c","contentencoded":"<p>In 2008, Lauren Beth Czekala-Chatham traveled with her then-partner from their home in Mississippi to San Francisco, a few months after gay marriage became legal in California. They'd been together for about a year and a half before they decided to get married.</p><p>After the ceremony, they went back to Mississippi, where they lived together. Then a year later, they decided to split up. The state of Mississippi doesn't recognize same-sex marriage, however, so they couldn't get a divorce there.</p><p>\"It's a very unfortunate predicament to be in, because you realize you cannot get divorced in your state of residence,\" says Kody Silva, a divorce attorney in Washington, D.C. \"And the state you were married in will not allow you to get divorced unless you go back and essentially become a resident of that state.\"</p><p>Silva says that you would have to live in the state you got married in for at least six months — or longer in some states. Establishing residency means getting utilities and a driver's license in your name.</p><p>\"You don't want to have to move in order to achieve a divorce that your straight couple friends can do without having to go through that hassle,\" Silva says.</p><p>It's more than just an address change, says Meaghan Hearn, an attorney who works with Silva in the District. \"You're talking about kids. You're talking about owning a house in one state, having kids in school in one state. You're already going through a tough time separating from your spouse, and to add this on top of it is another layer of complexity.\"</p><p>Hearn and Silva have seen quite a few same-sex divorce cases. When gay marriage became legal in D.C. on March 3, 2010, Silva says there was a lot of excitement. Couples who had been together for years went to the courthouse and got married, and so did couples who had only been together for a few months.</p><p>But the hype wore off quickly, Silva says. He's had a lot of divorce cases in which the marriage took place on or near March 3, 2010.</p><p>In Washington, D.C., and a handful of other states, divorce laws are slightly looser. The district allows people who were married in D.C. to travel back to the city and file. Once a couple can file, a divorce is a divorce.</p><p>Having to move to a different state isn't ideal, which is why advocates for marriage equality want the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a marriage equality case — not just for the sake of marriage, but for the sake of divorce too.</p><p>Back in Mississippi, Czekala-Chatham decided to take her case to court last year so she doesn't have to wait.</p><p>\"People get divorced. It's a part of life. We don't want it to happen, but it happens,\" she says. \"If we can get the state to recognize an out-of-state marriage, maybe down the road we can get them to recognize same-sex marriage and allow it in the state.\"</p><p>Czekala-Chatham lost the initial case, and has appealed the decision. She's currently waiting for a new court date.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2015 NPR.
